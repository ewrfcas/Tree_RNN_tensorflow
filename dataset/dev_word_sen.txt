Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary xylem in the stems of trees , or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or --OOV-- needed ] In a living tree it performs a support function , enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves .
It also conveys water and nutrients between the leaves , other growing tissues , and the roots .
The Earth contains about 434 billion cubic meters of growing stock forest , 47 % of which is commercial .

Dominant uses were for furniture and building construction .
In 1991 , approximately 3.5 cubic kilometers of wood were harvested .
As an abundant , carbon - neutral renewable resource , woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy .
A 2011 discovery in the Canadian province of New Brunswick uncovered the earliest known plants to have grown wood , approximately 395 to 400 million years ago .

Wood , in the strict sense , is yielded by trees , which increase in diameter by the formation , between the existing wood and the inner bark , of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem , living branches , and roots .
Wood , in the strict sense , is yielded by trees , which increase in diameter by the formation , between the existing wood and the inner bark , of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem , living branches , and roots .
This process is known as secondary growth ; it is the result of cell division in the vascular cambium , a lateral meristem , and subsequent expansion of the new cells .
Where there are clear seasons , growth can occur in a discrete annual or seasonal pattern , leading to growth rings ; these can usually be most clearly seen on the end of a log , but are also visible on the other surfaces .
If these seasons are annual these growth rings are referred to as annual rings .
If there are differences within a growth ring , then the part of a growth ring nearest the center of the tree , and formed early in the growing season when growth is rapid , is usually composed of wider elements .
It is usually lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring , and is known as earlywood or springwood .
The outer portion formed later in the season is then known as the latewood or summerwood .

A knot is a particular type of imperfection in a piece of wood ; it will affect the technical properties of the wood , usually reducing the local strength and increasing the tendency for splitting along the wood grain , but may be exploited for visual effect .

In a longitudinally sawn plank , a knot will appear as a roughly circular " solid " ( usually darker ) piece of wood around which the grain of the rest of the wood " flows " ( parts and rejoins ) .
In a longitudinally sawn plank , a knot will appear as a roughly circular " solid " ( usually darker ) piece of wood around which the grain of the rest of the wood " flows " ( parts and rejoins ) .
Within a knot , the direction of the wood ( grain direction ) is up to 90 degrees different from the grain direction of the regular wood .
In the tree a knot is either the base of a side branch or a dormant bud .
A knot ( when the base of a side branch ) is conical in shape ( hence the roughly circular cross - section ) with the inner tip at the point in stem diameter at which the plant 's vascular cambium was located when the branch formed as a bud .

During the development of a tree , the lower limbs often die , but may remain attached for a time , sometimes years .
During the development of a tree , the lower limbs often die , but may remain attached for a time , sometimes years .
Subsequent layers of growth of the attaching stem are no longer intimately joined with the dead limb , but are grown around it .
Hence , dead branches produce knots which are not attached , and likely to drop out after the tree has been sawn into boards .
Hence , dead branches produce knots which are not attached , and likely to drop out after the tree has been sawn into boards .
In grading lumber and structural timber , knots are classified according to their form , size , soundness , and the firmness with which they are held in place .
In grading lumber and structural timber , knots are classified according to their form , size , soundness , and the firmness with which they are held in place .
This firmness is affected by , among other factors , the length of time for which the branch was dead while the attaching stem continued to grow .
The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects .
Knots do not necessarily influence the stiffness of structural timber , this will depend on the size and location .
Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects .
Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain .
In some decorative applications , wood with knots may be desirable to add visual interest .
In applications where wood is painted , such as skirting boards , fascia boards , door frames and furniture , resins present in the timber may continue to ' bleed ' through to the surface of a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain .
A knot primer paint or solution , correctly applied during preparation , may do much to reduce this problem but it is difficult to control completely , especially when using mass - produced kiln - dried timber stocks .

Heartwood ( or --OOV-- ) is wood that as a result of a naturally occurring chemical transformation has become more resistant to decay .
Heartwood ( or --OOV-- ) is wood that as a result of a naturally occurring chemical transformation has become more resistant to decay .
Heartwood formation occurs spontaneously ( it is a genetically programmed process ) .
Once heartwood formation is complete , the heartwood is dead .
Some uncertainty still exists as to whether heartwood is truly dead , as it can still chemically react to decay organisms , but only once .
Heartwood is often visually distinct from the living sapwood , and can be distinguished in a cross - section where the boundary will tend to follow the growth rings .
For example , it is sometimes much darker .
However , other processes such as decay or insect invasion can also discolor wood , even in woody plants that do not form heartwood , which may lead to confusion .

Sapwood ( or --OOV-- ) is the younger , outermost wood ; in the growing tree it is living wood , and its principal functions are to conduct water from the roots to the leaves and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves .

All wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood .
Hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests .
Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life , so having only a thin layer of live sapwood , while in others the change comes slowly .
The term heartwood derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree .
Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as chestnut , black locust , mulberry , osage - orange , and sassafras , while in maple , ash , hickory , hackberry , beech , and pine , thick sapwood is the rule .

Within the same species the cross - sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional to the size of the crown of the tree .
If the rings are narrow , more of them are required than where they are wide .
As the tree gets larger , the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume .
Sapwood is thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base , because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less .
Sapwood is thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base , because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less .
When a tree is very young it is covered with limbs almost , if not entirely , to the ground , but as it grows older some or all of them will eventually die and are either broken off or fall off .
Subsequent growth of wood may completely conceal the stubs which will however remain as knots .
Consequently , the sapwood of an old tree , and particularly of a forest - grown tree , will be freer from knots than the inner heartwood .
Subsequent growth of wood may completely conceal the stubs which will however remain as knots .
Since in most uses of wood , knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties , it follows that a given piece of sapwood , because of its position in the tree , may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree .
Every broken limb or root , or deep wound from fire , insects , or falling timber , may afford an entrance for decay , which , once started , may penetrate to all parts of the trunk .

The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness .
It is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does , since in many cases it is hundreds , and in a few instances thousands , of years old .
The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness .
If a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of soil and site remain unchanged , it will make its most rapid growth in youth , and gradually decline .
The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide , but later they become narrower and narrower .
As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened , thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings .
As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened , thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings .
In the case of forest - grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate .
Different pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly , particularly if the tree is big and mature .
In a large log the sapwood , because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown , may be inferior in hardness , strength , and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log .

Different pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly , particularly if the tree is big and mature .
In species which show a distinct difference between heartwood and sapwood the natural color of heartwood is usually darker than that of the sapwood , and very frequently the contrast is conspicuous ( see section of yew log above ) .
This is produced by deposits in the heartwood of chemical substances , so that a dramatic color difference does not mean a dramatic difference in the mechanical properties of heartwood and sapwood , although there may be a dramatic chemical difference .

Some experiments on very resinous Longleaf Pine specimens indicate an increase in strength , due to the resin which increases the strength when dry .
Such resin - saturated heartwood is called " fat lighter " .
Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and termites ; however they are very flammable .
Spruce impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby .
Stumps of old longleaf pines are often dug , split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires .
Since the latewood of a growth ring is usually darker in color than the earlywood , this fact may be used in judging the density , and therefore the hardness and strength of the material .
Since the latewood of a growth ring is usually darker in color than the earlywood , this fact may be used in judging the density , and therefore the hardness and strength of the material .
This is particularly the case with coniferous woods .
In ring - porous woods the vessels of the early wood not infrequently appear on a finished surface as darker than the denser latewood , though on cross sections of heartwood the reverse is commonly true .
Except in the manner just stated the color of wood is no indication of strength .
Abnormal discoloration of wood often denotes a diseased condition , indicating unsoundness .

The black check in western hemlock is the result of insect attacks .
The reddish - brown streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly the result of injury by birds .
Certain rot - producing fungi impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become symptomatic of weakness ; however an attractive effect known as spalting produced by this process is often considered a desirable characteristic .
Wood that is thoroughly air - dried retains --OOV-- % of the water in the cell walls , and none , or practically none , in the other forms .
Wood that is thoroughly air - dried retains --OOV-- % of the water in the cell walls , and none , or practically none , in the other forms .
Even oven - dried wood retains a small percentage of moisture , but for all except chemical purposes , may be considered absolutely dry .
The general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable .
A similar effect of common observation is in the softening action of water on rawhide , paper , or cloth .

Within certain limits , the greater the water content , the greater its softening effect .

Drying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood , particularly in small specimens .
An extreme example is the case of a completely dry spruce block 5 cm in section , which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green ( undried ) block of the same size will .

The greatest strength increase due to drying is in the ultimate crushing strength , and strength at elastic limit in endwise compression ; these are followed by the modulus of rupture , and stress at elastic limit in cross - bending , while the modulus of elasticity is least affected .

Wood is a heterogeneous , hygroscopic , cellular and anisotropic material .
It consists of cells , and the cell walls are composed of micro - fibrils of cellulose ( 40 % – 50 % ) and hemicellulose ( 15 % – 25 % ) impregnated with lignin ( 15 % – 30 % ) .

In coniferous or softwood species the wood cells are mostly of one kind , tracheids , and as a result the material is much more uniform in structure than that of most hardwoods .

The structure of hardwoods is more complex .
The water conducting capability is mostly taken care of by vessels : in some cases ( oak , chestnut , ash ) these are quite large and distinct , in others ( buckeye , poplar , willow ) too small to be seen without a hand lens .

In discussing such woods it is customary to divide them into two large classes , ring - porous and diffuse - porous .
In ring - porous species , such as ash , black locust , catalpa , chestnut , elm , hickory , mulberry , and oak , the larger vessels or pores ( as cross sections of vessels are called ) are localised in the part of the growth ring formed in spring , thus forming a region of more or less open and porous tissue .

The rest of the ring , produced in summer , is made up of smaller vessels and a much greater proportion of wood fibers .

These fibers are the elements which give strength and toughness to wood , while the vessels are a source of --OOV-- needed ]
In diffuse - porous woods the pores are evenly sized so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the growth ring instead of being collected in a band or row .
Examples of this kind of wood are alder , --OOV-- needed ] birch , buckeye , maple , willow , and the Populus species such as aspen , cottonwood and poplar .
Some species , such as walnut and cherry , are on the border between the two classes , forming an intermediate --OOV-- needed ]

In temperate softwoods there often is a marked difference between latewood and earlywood .
The latewood will be denser than that formed early in the season .
The strength is in the walls , not the cavities .
When examined under a microscope the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick - walled and with very small cell cavities , while those formed first in the season have thin walls and large cell cavities .

If a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other , and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings .

In white pines there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring , and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work .
In white pines there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring , and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work .
In hard pines , on the other hand , the latewood is very dense and is deep - colored , presenting a very decided contrast to the soft , straw - colored earlywood .
It is not only the proportion of latewood , but also its quality , that counts .
One can judge comparative density , and therefore to some extent strength , by visual inspection .
One can judge comparative density , and therefore to some extent strength , by visual inspection .
In specimens that show a very large proportion of latewood it may be noticeably more porous and weigh considerably less than the latewood in pieces that contain but little .
The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed , though it is not possible to formulate a rule governing it .
In general , however , it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential , woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen .
In conifers , at least , rate of growth alone does not determine the proportion of the two portions of the ring , for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy , while in others the opposite is true .
No satisfactory explanation can as yet be given for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood .

In ring - porous woods each season 's growth is always well defined , because the large pores formed early in the season abut on the denser tissue of the year before .

In the case of the ring - porous hardwoods there seems to exist a pretty definite relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties .
This may be briefly summed up in the general statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings of growth , the heavier , harder , stronger , and stiffer the wood .
This , it must be remembered , applies only to ring - porous woods such as oak , ash , hickory , and others of the same group , and is , of course , subject to some exceptions and limitations .

This , it must be remembered , applies only to ring - porous woods such as oak , ash , hickory , and others of the same group , and is , of course , subject to some exceptions and limitations .
In ring - porous woods of good growth it is usually the latewood in which the thick - walled , strength - giving fibers are most abundant .
As the breadth of ring diminishes , this latewood is reduced so that very slow growth produces comparatively light , porous wood composed of thin - walled vessels and wood parenchyma .
As the breadth of ring diminishes , this latewood is reduced so that very slow growth produces comparatively light , porous wood composed of thin - walled vessels and wood parenchyma .
In good oak these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log , while in inferior material they may make up 25 % or more .
The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm , and consists mostly of thick - walled fibers which form one - half or more of the wood .
Wide - ringed wood is often called " second - growth " , because the growth of the young timber in open stands after the old trees have been removed is more rapid than in trees in a closed forest , and in the manufacture of articles where strength is an important consideration such " second - growth " hardwood material is preferred .

This is particularly the case in the choice of hickory for handles and spokes .
The results of a series of tests on hickory by the U.S. Forest Service show that :
In the diffuse - porous woods , the demarcation between rings is not always so clear and in some cases is almost ( if not entirely ) invisible to the unaided eye .
Conversely , when there is a clear demarcation there may not be a noticeable difference in structure within the growth ring .

In diffuse - porous woods , as has been stated , the vessels or pores are even - sized , so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood .
In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown .
In diffuse - porous woods , as has been stated , the vessels or pores are even - sized , so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood .
The effect of rate of growth is , therefore , not the same as in the ring - porous woods , approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers .
If ease of working is prized , wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain , which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season 's growth and the earlywood of the next .
Structural material that resembles ordinary , " dicot " or conifer wood in its gross handling characteristics is produced by a number of monocot plants , and these also are colloquially called wood .

Of these , bamboo , botanically a member of the grass family , has considerable economic importance , larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material in their own right and , these days , in the manufacture of engineered flooring , panels and veneer .

Another major plant group that produce material that often is called wood are the palms .
The single most revealing property of wood as an indicator of wood quality is specific gravity ( --OOV-- 1986 ) , as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it .
The single most revealing property of wood as an indicator of wood quality is specific gravity ( --OOV-- 1986 ) , as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it .
Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water ; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance , e.g. , grams per millilitre ( g / cm3 or g / ml ) .
Upon drying , wood shrinks and its density increases .
Minimum values are associated with green ( water - saturated ) wood and are referred to as basic specific gravity ( --OOV-- 1986 ) .
Wood density is determined by multiple growth and physiological factors compounded into “ one fairly easily measured wood characteristic ” ( Elliott 1970 ) .

Wood density is determined by multiple growth and physiological factors compounded into “ one fairly easily measured wood characteristic ” ( Elliott 1970 ) .
Variation is to be expected .
Age , diameter , height , radial growth , geographical location , site and growing conditions , silvicultural treatment , and seed source , all to some degree influence wood density .
Variation of specific gravity within the bole of a tree can occur in either the horizontal or vertical direction .
Within an individual tree , the variation in wood density is often as great as or even greater than that between different trees ( --OOV-- 1986 ) .
Age , diameter , height , radial growth , geographical location , site and growing conditions , silvicultural treatment , and seed source , all to some degree influence wood density .

The well - known balsa ( a hardwood ) is actually softer than any commercial softwood .
Conversely , some softwoods ( e.g. yew ) are harder than many hardwoods .

There is a strong relationship between the properties of wood and the properties of the particular tree that yielded it .
The density of wood varies with species .
The density of a wood correlates with its strength ( mechanical properties ) .
For example , mahogany is a medium - dense hardwood that is excellent for fine furniture crafting , whereas balsa is light , making it useful for model building .

The chemical composition of wood varies from species to species , but is approximately 50 % carbon , 42 % oxygen , 6 % hydrogen , 1 % nitrogen , and 1 % other elements ( mainly calcium , potassium , sodium , magnesium , iron , and manganese ) by weight .

The island has a population of 267 as of January 2016 .
This includes Saint Helena and equatorial Ascension Island some 3,730 kilometres ( 2,318 mi ) to the north of Tristan .
The islands were first sighted in 1506 by Portuguese explorer Tristão da Cunha ; rough seas prevented a landing .

Some sources state that the Portuguese made the first landing in 1520 , when the --OOV-- Rafael captained by Ruy Vaz Pereira called at Tristan for water .
The first permanent settler was Jonathan Lambert , from Salem , Massachusetts , United States , who arrived at the islands in December 1810 with two other men .
The first permanent settler was Jonathan Lambert , from Salem , Massachusetts , United States , who arrived at the islands in December 1810 with two other men .
Lambert publicly declared the islands his property and named them the Islands of Refreshment .
In 1816 , the United Kingdom annexed the islands , ruling them from the Cape Colony in South Africa .

In 1867 , Prince Alfred , Duke of Edinburgh and second son of Queen Victoria , visited the islands .
The main settlement , Edinburgh of the Seven Seas , was named in honour of his visit .
Lewis Carroll 's youngest brother , the Reverend Edwin Heron Dodgson , served as an Anglican missionary and schoolteacher in Tristan da Cunha in the 1880s .
However , the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 , together with the gradual move from sailing ships to coal - fired steam ships , increased the isolation of the islands , as they were no longer needed as a stopping port or for shelter for journeys from Europe to East Asia .
On 12 January 1938 by Letters Patent the islands were declared a dependency of Saint Helena .
During World War II , the islands were used as a top secret Royal Navy weather and radio station codenamed HMS Atlantic Isle , to monitor Nazi U - boats ( which were required to maintain radio contact ) and shipping movements in the South Atlantic Ocean .

The 1961 eruption of Queen Mary 's Peak forced the evacuation of the entire population via Cape Town to England .
Most families returned in 1963 .
The following year a Royal Society expedition went to the islands to assess the damage , and reported that the settlement of Edinburgh of the Seven Seas had been only marginally affected .
On 23 May 2001 , the islands experienced an extratropical cyclone that generated winds up to 190 kilometres per hour ( 120 mph ) .
A number of structures were severely damaged and a large number of cattle were killed , prompting emergency aid , provided by the British government .
On 4 December 2007 an outbreak of an acute virus - induced flu was reported .
On 13 February 2008 , fire destroyed the fishing factory and the four generators that supplied power to the island .
On 14 March 2008 , new generators were installed and uninterrupted power was restored .
While a new factory was being planned and built , M / V Kelso came to the island and acted as a factory ship , with island fishermen based on board for stints normally of one week .
The new facility was ready in July 2009 , for the start of the --OOV-- fishing season .
On 16 March 2011 , the freighter MS Oliva ran aground on Nightingale Island , spilling tons of heavy fuel oil into the ocean , leaving an oil slick threatening the island 's population of rockhopper penguins .

In the human digestive system , food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication ( chewing ) , a form of mechanical digestion , and the wetting contact of saliva .
Saliva , a liquid secreted by the salivary glands , contains salivary amylase , an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food ; the saliva also contains mucus , which lubricates the food , and hydrogen carbonate , which provides the ideal conditions of pH ( alkaline ) for amylase to work .

After undergoing mastication and starch digestion , the food will be in the form of a small , round slurry mass called a bolus .
It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis .
Other animals , such as rabbits and rodents , practise coprophagia behaviours - eating specialised faeces in order to re - digest food , especially in the case of roughage .
Instead they extract more nutrition from grass by giving their food a second pass through the gut .
Soft faecal pellets of partially digested food are excreted and generally consumed immediately .
They also produce normal droppings , which are not eaten .
There is a fundamental distinction between internal and external digestion .
External digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history , and most fungi still rely on it .
External digestion developed earlier in evolutionary history , and most fungi still rely on it .
Animals have a tube ( gastrointestinal tract ) in which internal digestion occurs , which is more efficient because more of the broken down products can be captured , and the internal chemical environment can be more efficiently controlled .

Such elements as the Agrobacterium Ti or Ri plasmids contain elements that can transfer to plant cells .
Transferred genes enter the plant cell nucleus and effectively transform the plant cells into factories for the production of opines , which the bacteria use as carbon and energy sources .

Teeth ( singular tooth ) are small whitish structures found in the jaws ( or mouths ) of many vertebrates that are used to tear , scrape , milk and chew food .
Teeth ( singular tooth ) are small whitish structures found in the jaws ( or mouths ) of many vertebrates that are used to tear , scrape , milk and chew food .
Teeth are not made of bone , but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness , such as enamel , dentine and cementum .
Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception .
This is the ability of sensation when chewing , for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth , such as a chipped plate mixed in food , our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it can not be chewed , so we stop trying .
The abomasum is the fourth and final stomach compartment in ruminants .
It is a close equivalent of a monogastric stomach ( e.g. , those in humans or pigs ) , and digesta is processed here in much the same way .
It serves primarily as a site for acid hydrolysis of microbial and dietary protein , preparing these protein sources for further digestion and absorption in the small intestine . digesta is finally moved into the small intestine , where the digestion and absorption of nutrients occurs .

Microbes produced in the --OOV-- - rumen are also digested in the small intestine .
An earthworm 's digestive system consists of a mouth , pharynx , esophagus , crop , gizzard , and intestine . The mouth is surrounded by strong lips , which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass , leaves , and weeds , with bits of soil to help chew .

The mouth is surrounded by strong lips , which act like a hand to grab pieces of dead grass , leaves , and weeds , with bits of soil to help chew .
In the pharynx , the food is lubricated by mucus secretions for easier passage .
The powerful muscles of the gizzard churn and mix the mass of food and dirt .
Digestion of some fats can begin in the mouth where lingual lipase breaks down some short chain lipids into diglycerides .
However fats are mainly digested in the small intestine .
The presence of fat in the small intestine produces hormones that stimulate the release of pancreatic lipase from the pancreas and bile from the liver which helps in the emulsification of fats for absorption of fatty acids .

Complete digestion of one molecule of fat ( a triglyceride ) results a mixture of fatty acids , --OOV-- and di - glycerides , as well as some undigested triglycerides , but no free glycerol molecules .
Digestion is the breakdown of large insoluble food molecules into small water - soluble food molecules so that they can be absorbed into the watery blood plasma .
In certain organisms , these smaller substances are absorbed through the small intestine into the blood stream .
Digestion is a form of catabolism that is often divided into two processes based on how food is broken down : mechanical and chemical digestion .
The term mechanical digestion refers to the physical breakdown of large pieces of food into smaller pieces which can subsequently be accessed by digestive enzymes .
In chemical digestion , enzymes break down food into the small molecules the body can use .
Different phases of digestion take place including : the cephalic phase , gastric phase , and intestinal phase .
The cephalic phase occurs at the sight , thought and smell of food , which stimulate the cerebral cortex .
Taste and smell stimuli are sent to the hypothalamus and medulla oblongata .
The gastric phase takes 3 to 4 hours .
It is stimulated by distension of the stomach , presence of food in stomach and decrease in pH. Distention activates long and myenteric reflexes .
In a channel --OOV-- system , several proteins form a contiguous channel traversing the inner and outer membranes of the bacteria .
It is a simple system , which consists of only three protein subunits : the ABC protein , membrane fusion protein ( MFP ) , and outer membrane protein ( --OOV-- ] .
This secretion system transports various molecules , from ions , drugs , to proteins of various sizes ( 20 - 900 kDa ) .
In addition to the use of the multiprotein complexes listed above , Gram - negative bacteria possess another method for release of material : the formation of outer membrane vesicles .
Portions of the outer membrane pinch off , forming spherical structures made of a lipid bilayer enclosing periplasmic materials .
While release of vesicles has been demonstrated as a general response to stress conditions , the process of loading cargo proteins seems to be selective .
Vesicles from a number of bacterial species have been found to contain virulence factors , some have immunomodulatory effects , and some can directly adhere to and intoxicate host cells .
Underlying the process is muscle movement throughout the system through swallowing and peristalsis .
Each step in digestion requires energy , and thus imposes an " overhead charge " on the energy made available from absorbed substances .
Each step in digestion requires energy , and thus imposes an " overhead charge " on the energy made available from absorbed substances .
Differences in that overhead cost are important influences on lifestyle , behavior , and even physical structures .
Digestion begins in the mouth with the secretion of saliva and its digestive enzymes .

Gastric juice contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin which would damage the walls of the stomach and mucus is secreted for protection .
Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts , glucose and galactose .
Lactase is an enzyme that breaks down the disaccharide lactose to its component parts , glucose and galactose .
Glucose and galactose can be absorbed by the small intestine .
Approximately 65 percent of the adult population produce only small amounts of lactase and are unable to eat unfermented milk - based foods .
This is commonly known as lactose intolerance .
After some time ( typically --OOV-- hours in humans , --OOV-- hours in dogs , --OOV-- hours in house --OOV-- needed ] the resulting thick liquid is called chyme .
When the pyloric sphincter valve opens , chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine , in which digestion continues .
When the pyloric sphincter valve opens , chyme enters the duodenum where it mixes with digestive enzymes from the pancreas and bile juice from the liver and then passes through the small intestine , in which digestion continues .
When the chyme is fully digested , it is absorbed into the blood .
95 % of absorption of nutrients occurs in the small intestine .
In mammals , preparation for digestion begins with the cephalic phase in which saliva is produced in the mouth and digestive enzymes are produced in the stomach .

Mechanical and chemical digestion begin in the mouth where food is chewed , and mixed with saliva to begin enzymatic processing of starches .
The stomach continues to break food down mechanically and chemically through churning and mixing with both acids and enzymes .
Absorption occurs in the stomach and gastrointestinal tract , and the process finishes with defecation .
Protein digestion occurs in the stomach and duodenum in which 3 main enzymes , pepsin secreted by the stomach and trypsin and chymotrypsin secreted by the pancreas , break down food proteins into polypeptides that are then broken down by various --OOV-- and --OOV-- into amino acids .

The first President of the Bank was Wim Duisenberg , the former president of the Dutch central bank and the European Monetary Institute .
While Duisenberg had been the head of the EMI ( taking over from Alexandre Lamfalussy of Belgium ) just before the ECB came into existence , the French government wanted Jean - Claude Trichet , former head of the French central bank , to be the ECB 's first president .
The French argued that since the ECB was to be located in Germany , its president should be French .
Tensions were abated by a gentleman 's agreement in which Duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate , to be replaced by Trichet .
The Governing Council in October 1998 defined price stability as inflation of under 2 % , “ a year - on - year increase in the Harmonised Index of Consumer Prices ( HICP ) for the euro area of below 2 % ” and added that price stability ” was to be maintained over the medium term ” .

To offer some accountability , the ECB is bound to publish reports on its activities and has to address its annual report to the European Parliament , the European Commission , the Council of the European Union and the European Council .
From late 2009 a handful of mainly southern eurozone member states started being unable to repay their national Euro - denominated government debt or to finance the bail - out of troubled financial sectors under their national supervision without the assistance of third parties .
As a consequence , the ability of these states to borrow new money to further finance their budget deficits or to refinance existing unsustainable debt levels was strongly reduced .

However , if the debt rescheduling causes losses on loans held by European banks , it weakens the private banking system , which then puts pressure on the central bank to come to the aid of those banks .
Another possible response is for wealthy member countries to guarantee or purchase the debt of countries that have defaulted or are likely to default .

In the repos the ownership of the collateral changes to the ECB until the loan is repaid .
The normal procedure used by the ECB for manipulating the money supply has been via the so - called refinancing facilities .
In these facilities , bonds are not purchased but used in reverse transactions : repurchase agreements , or collateralised loans .
In contrast to the Fed , the ECB normally does not buy bonds outright .
ECB buying focused primarily on Spanish and Italian debt .
The ECB always could , and through the late summer of 2011 did , purchase bonds issued by the weaker states even though it assumes , in doing so , the risk of a deteriorating balance sheet .
Purchases of Italian bonds by the central bank , for example , were intended to dampen international speculation and strengthen portfolios in the private sector and also the central bank .

One is sterilisation , in which highly valued assets are sold at the same time that the weaker assets are purchased , which keeps the money supply neutral .
Another technique is simply to accept the bad assets as long - term collateral ( as opposed to short - term repo swaps ) to be held until their market value stabilises .
This would imply , as a quid pro quo , adjustments in taxation and expenditure in the economies of the weaker states to improve the perceived value of the assets .

The European Central Bank had stepped up the buying of member nations debt .

In response to the crisis of 2010 , some proposals have surfaced for a collective European bond issue that would allow the central bank to purchase a European version of US Treasury bills .
The latter can be seen , for example , in the bank 's intervention during the subprime mortgage crisis when it loaned billions of euros to banks to stabilise the financial system .

Finally , it contributes to maintaining a stable financial system and monitoring the banking sector .

In central banking , the privileged status of the central bank is that it can make as much money as it deems needed .
In the United States Federal Reserve Bank , the Federal Reserve buys assets : typically , bonds issued by the Federal government .
There is no limit on the bonds that it can buy and one of the tools at its disposal in a financial crisis is to take such extraordinary measures as the purchase of large amounts of assets such as commercial paper .
The purpose of such operations is to ensure that adequate liquidity is available for functioning of the financial system .
In essence , they forced European banks , and , more importantly , the European Central Bank itself e.g. when gauging the solvency of financial institutions , to rely more than ever on standardised assessments of credit risk marketed by two non - European private agencies : Moody 's and --OOV--

The bank is based in Frankfurt , the largest financial centre in the Eurozone .
Its location in the city is fixed by the Amsterdam Treaty .
The bank moved to new purpose - built headquarters in 2014 which were designed a Vienna - based architectural office named Coop --OOV-- .
The building is approximately 180 metres ( 591 ft ) tall and will be accompanied with other secondary buildings on a landscaped site on the site of the former wholesale market in the eastern part of Frankfurt am Main .
The main construction began in October 2008 , and it was expected that the building will become an architectural symbol for Europe .
The by far biggest amount of € --OOV-- was tapped by banks in Greece , Ireland , Italy and Spain .
It also hoped that banks would use some of the money to buy government bonds , effectively easing the debt crisis .
This way the ECB tried to make sure that banks have enough cash to pay off € 200bn of their own maturing debts in the first three months of 2012 , and at the same time keep operating and loaning to businesses so that a credit crunch does not choke off economic growth .

In psychology , memory is the process in which information is encoded , stored , and retrieved . Encoding allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli .
Some retrieval attempts may be effortless due to the type of information , and other attempts to remember stored information may be more demanding for various reasons .
Encoding allows information from the outside world to be sensed in the form of chemical and physical stimuli . In the first stage the information must be changed so that it may be put into the encoding process .
Storage is the second memory stage or process .
Finally the third process is the retrieval of information that has been stored .
Short - term memory is believed to rely mostly on an acoustic code for storing information , and to a lesser extent a visual code . Conrad ( 1964 ) found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of letters that were acoustically similar ( e.g. E , P , D ) .

Conrad ( 1964 ) found that test subjects had more difficulty recalling collections of letters that were acoustically similar ( e.g. E , P , D ) . Confusion with recalling acoustically similar letters rather than visually similar letters implies that the letters were encoded acoustically . Conrad 's ( 1964 ) study , however , deals with the encoding of written text ; thus , while memory of written language may rely on acoustic components , generalisations to all forms of memory can not be made .

Short - term memory is also known as working memory . Short - term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal .
Short - term memory allows recall for a period of several seconds to a minute without rehearsal .
Its capacity is also very limited : George A. Miller ( 1956 ) , when working at Bell Laboratories , conducted experiments showing that the store of short - term memory was --OOV-- items ( the title of his famous paper , " The magical number --OOV-- " ) .
Modern estimates of the capacity of short - term memory are lower , typically of the order of --OOV-- items ; however , memory capacity can be increased through a process called chunking . For example , in recalling a ten - digit telephone number , a person could chunk the digits into three groups : first , the area code ( such as 123 ) , then a three - digit chunk ( 456 ) and lastly a four - digit chunk ( 7890 ) .
This method of remembering telephone numbers is far more effective than attempting to remember a string of 10 digits ; this is because we are able to chunk the information into meaningful groups of numbers .
The storage in sensory memory and short - term memory generally has a strictly limited capacity and duration , which means that information is not retained indefinitely .
By contrast , long - term memory can store much larger quantities of information for potentially unlimited duration ( sometimes a whole life span ) .
Its capacity is immeasurable .
For example , given a random seven - digit number we may remember it for only a few seconds before forgetting , suggesting it was stored in our short - term memory .
For example , short - term memory can be broken up into different units such as visual information and acoustic information .
In a study by --OOV-- and Gerber ( 1986 ) , patient ' KF ' demonstrated certain deviations from the Atkinson – Shiffrin model .
In a study by --OOV-- and Gerber ( 1986 ) , patient ' KF ' demonstrated certain deviations from the Atkinson – Shiffrin model . Patient KF was brain damaged , displaying difficulties regarding short - term memory .
Patient KF was brain damaged , displaying difficulties regarding short - term memory . Recognition of sounds such as spoken numbers , letters , words and easily identifiable noises ( such as doorbells and cats meowing ) were all impacted .
Interestingly , visual short - term memory was unaffected , suggesting a dichotomy between visual and audial memory .
Short - term memory is supported by transient patterns of neuronal communication , dependent on regions of the frontal lobe ( especially dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ) and the parietal lobe .
The hippocampus is essential ( for learning new information ) to the consolidation of information from short - term to long - term memory , although it does not seem to store information itself .
The hippocampus is essential ( for learning new information ) to the consolidation of information from short - term to long - term memory , although it does not seem to store information itself .
Furthermore , it may be involved in changing neural connections for a period of three months or more after the initial learning .
Sensory memory holds sensory information less than one second after an item is perceived .
It is out of cognitive control and is an automatic response .
The first experiments exploring this form of sensory memory were conducted by George Sperling ( 1963 ) using the " partial report paradigm " .
Because this form of memory degrades so quickly , participants would see the display but be unable to report all of the items ( 12 in the " whole report " procedure ) before they decayed .
While short - term memory encodes information acoustically , long - term memory encodes it semantically : Baddeley ( 1966 ) discovered that , after 20 minutes , test subjects had the most difficulty recalling a collection of words that had similar meanings ( e.g. big , large , great , huge ) long - term .

Another part of long - term memory is episodic memory , " which attempts to capture information such as ' what ' , ' when ' and ' where ' " .

Infants do not have the language ability to report on their memories and so verbal reports can not be used to assess very young children ’s memory .
Throughout the years , however , researchers have adapted and developed a number of measures for assessing both --OOV-- recognition memory and their recall memory . Habituation and operant conditioning techniques have been used to assess --OOV-- recognition memory and the deferred and elicited imitation techniques have been used to assess --OOV-- recall memory .

Thus , retrospective memory as a category includes semantic , episodic and autobiographical memory .
Time - based prospective memories are triggered by a time - cue , such as going to the doctor ( action ) at 4 pm ( cue ) .
Cues do not need to be related to the action ( as the mailbox / letter example ) , and lists , sticky - notes , knotted handkerchiefs , or string around the finger all exemplify cues that people use as strategies to enhance prospective memory .
Event - based prospective memories are intentions triggered by cues , such as remembering to post a letter ( action ) after seeing a mailbox ( cue ) .
Later research showed this to be false .
Research has shown that direct injections of cortisol or epinephrine help the storage of recent experiences .
This proves that excitement enhances memory by the stimulation of hormones that affect the amygdala .
The hippocampus receives input from different parts of the cortex and sends its output out to different parts of the brain also .
One question that is crucial in cognitive neuroscience is how information and mental experiences are coded and represented in the brain .
Scientists have gained much knowledge about the neuronal codes from the studies of plasticity , but most of such research has been focused on simple learning in simple neuronal circuits ; it is considerably less clear about the neuronal changes involved in more complex examples of memory , particularly declarative memory that requires the storage of facts and events ( Byrne 2007 ) .
Convergence - divergence zones might be the neural networks where memories are stored and retrieved .

Cognitive neuroscientists consider memory as the retention , reactivation , and reconstruction of the experience - independent internal representation .
The term of internal representation implies that such definition of memory contains two components : the expression of memory at the behavioral or conscious level , and the underpinning physical neural changes ( Dudai 2007 ) .
Some neuroscientists and psychologists mistakenly equate the concept of engram and memory , broadly conceiving all persisting after - effects of experiences as memory ; others argue against this notion that memory does not exist until it is revealed in behavior or thought ( Moscovitch 2007 ) .

In contrast , procedural memory ( or implicit memory ) is not based on the conscious recall of information , but on implicit learning .
In contrast , procedural memory ( or implicit memory ) is not based on the conscious recall of information , but on implicit learning .
Procedural memory is primarily employed in learning motor skills and should be considered a subset of implicit memory .
It is revealed when one does better in a given task due only to repetition - no new explicit memories have been formed , but one is unconsciously accessing aspects of those previous experiences .
The working memory model explains many practical observations , such as why it is easier to do two different tasks ( one verbal and one visual ) than two similar tasks ( e.g. , two visual ) , and the aforementioned word - length effect .
However , the concept of a central executive as noted here has been criticised as inadequate and --OOV-- needed ] Working memory is also the premise for what allows us to do everyday activities involving thought .

One of the key concerns of older adults is the experience of memory loss , especially as it is one of the hallmark symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease .
However , memory loss is qualitatively different in normal aging from the kind of memory loss associated with a diagnosis of Alzheimer 's ( --OOV-- & Price , 2005 ) .
Research has revealed that --OOV-- performance on memory tasks that rely on frontal regions declines with age .
Older adults can manage their problems with prospective memory by using appointment books , for example .
It should be noted that although 6-month - olds can recall information over the short - term , they have difficulty recalling the temporal order of information .
It is only by 9 months of age that infants can recall the actions of a two - step sequence in the correct temporal order - that is , recalling step 1 and then step 2 .
Younger infants ( 6-month - olds ) can only recall one step of a two - step sequence .
Researchers have suggested that these age differences are probably due to the fact that the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and the frontal components of the neural network are not fully developed at the age of 6-months .
Episodic memories often reflect the " firsts " in life such as a first kiss , first day of school or first time winning a championship .
Semantic memory allows the encoding of abstract knowledge about the world , such as " Paris is the capital of France " .
Autobiographical memory - memory for particular events within one 's own life - is generally viewed as either equivalent to , or a subset of , episodic memory .
Visual memory is part of memory preserving some characteristics of our senses pertaining to visual experience .
Stress has a significant effect on memory formation and learning .
Behavioural research on animals shows that chronic stress produces adrenal hormones which impact the hippocampal structure in the brains of rats .
An experimental study by German cognitive psychologists L. Schwabe and O. Wolf demonstrates how learning under stress also decreases memory recall in humans .
The researchers suggest that stress experienced during learning distracts people by diverting their attention during the memory encoding process .
Interference can hamper memorization and retrieval .
There is retroactive interference , when learning new information makes it harder to recall old information and proactive interference , where prior learning disrupts recall of new information .

Knowing Latin , for instance , can help an individual learn a related language such as French – this phenomenon is known as positive transfer .
Up until the middle of the 1980s it was assumed that infants could not encode , retain , and retrieve information . A growing body of research now indicates that infants as young as 6-months can recall information after a 24-hour delay .

Furthermore , research has revealed that as infants grow older they can store information for longer periods of time ; 6-month - olds can recall information after a 24-hour period , 9-month - olds after up to five weeks , and 20-month - olds after as long as twelve months .

For example , the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning , while the amygdala is thought to be involved in emotional memory .
Further , it is not sufficient to describe memory , and its counterpart , learning , as solely dependent on specific brain regions .
Learning and memory are attributed to changes in neuronal synapses , thought to be mediated by long - term potentiation and long - term depression .
For example , the hippocampus is believed to be involved in spatial learning and declarative learning , while the amygdala is thought to be involved in emotional memory .
The more long term the exposure to stress is , the more impact it may have . However , short term exposure to stress also causes impairment in memory by interfering with the function of the hippocampus .
Research shows that subjects placed in a stressful situation for a short amount of time still have blood glucocorticoid levels that have increased drastically when measured after the exposure is completed .
Although the stress is applied prenatally , the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life .
When subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they have often difficulties .
The CA1 neurons found in the hippocampus are destroyed due to glucocorticoids decreasing the release of glucose and the reuptake of glutamate .
Therefore , the more stressful situations that someone encounters , the more susceptible they are to memory loss later on .
Stressful life experiences can also cause repression of memories where a person moves an unbearable memory to the unconscious mind .
This high level of extracellular glutamate allow calcium to enter NMDA receptors which in return kills neurons .
There have been several studies which show that sleep improves the retention of memory , as memories are enhanced through active consolidation .
System consolidation takes place during slow - wave sleep ( SWS ) .
System consolidation takes place during slow - wave sleep ( SWS ) .
The neocortex then reviews and processes memories , which moves them into long - term memory .
Additionally , data obtained from neuroimaging studies have shown activation patterns in the sleeping brain that mirror those recorded during the learning of tasks from the previous day , suggesting that new memories may be solidified through such rehearsal .
A UCLA research study published in the June 2006 issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry found that people can improve cognitive function and brain efficiency through simple lifestyle changes such as incorporating memory exercises , healthy eating , physical fitness and stress reduction into their daily lives .

After 14 days , they showed greater word fluency ( not memory ) compared to their baseline performance . No long term follow up was conducted , it is therefore unclear if this intervention has lasting effects on memory .

Loss of memory is known as amnesia . Amnesia can result from extensive damage to : ( a ) the regions of the medial temporal lobe , such as the hippocampus , dentate gyrus , subiculum , amygdala , the parahippocampal , entorhinal , and perirhinal cortices or the ( b ) midline diencephalic region , specifically the dorsomedial nucleus of the thalamus and the mammillary bodies of the hypothalamus .
Other neurological disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease and Parkinson 's disease can also affect memory and cognition .
Korsakoff 's syndrome , also known as Korsakoff 's psychosis , amnesic - --OOV-- syndrome , is an organic brain disease that adversely affects memory by widespread loss or shrinkage of neurons within the prefrontal cortex .
There are many sorts of amnesia , and by studying their different forms , it has become possible to observe apparent defects in individual sub - systems of the brain 's memory systems , and thus hypothesize their function in the normally working brain .
--OOV-- , or --OOV-- syndrome , is a disorder that affects an individual 's autobiographical memory , essentially meaning that they can not forget small details that otherwise would not be stored .
Physical exercise , particularly continuous aerobic exercises such as running , cycling and swimming , has many cognitive benefits and effects on the brain . Influences on the brain include increases in neurotransmitter levels , improved oxygen and nutrient delivery , and increased neurogenesis in the hippocampus .
The effects of exercise on memory have important implications for improving children 's academic performance , maintaining mental abilities in old age , and the prevention and potential cure of neurological diseases .

Physical exercise , particularly continuous aerobic exercises such as running , cycling and swimming , has many cognitive benefits and effects on the brain .
However , memory performance can be enhanced when material is linked to the learning context , even when learning occurs under stress .
All participants in the experiment , both stressed and unstressed , performed faster when the learning and retrieval contexts were similar .
The room in which the experiment took place was infused with the scent of vanilla , as odour is a strong cue for memory . Retention testing took place the following day , either in the same room with the vanilla scent again present , or in a different room without the fragrance .
A separate study by cognitive psychologists Schwabe and Wolf shows that when retention testing is done in a context similar to or congruent with the original learning task ( i.e. , in the same room ) , memory impairment and the detrimental effects of stress on learning can be attenuated . Seventy - two healthy female and male university students , randomly assigned to the --OOV-- stress test or to a control group , were asked to remember the locations of 15 pairs of picture cards – a computerized version of the card game " Concentration " or " Memory " .

Interestingly , research has revealed that asking individuals to repeatedly imagine actions that they have never performed or events that they have never experienced could result in false memories .
For instance , Goff and Roediger ( 1998 ) asked participants to imagine that they performed an act ( e.g. , break a toothpick ) and then later asked them whether they had done such a thing .
The researchers found that one - fourth of the students asked to imagine the four events reported that they had actually experienced such events as children .
In fact , research has revealed that our memories are constructed .
People can construct their memories when they encode them and/or when they recall them . To illustrate , consider a classic study conducted by Elizabeth Loftus and John Palmer ( 1974 ) in which people were instructed to watch a film of a traffic accident and then asked about what they saw .
The findings of this experiment were replicated around the world , and researchers consistently demonstrated that when people were provided with misleading information they tended to misremember , a phenomenon known as the misinformation effect .
There was no broken glass depicted in the film .
Rote learning is the method most often used .
Also relevant is the Zeigarnik effect which states that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones . The so - called Method of loci uses spatial memory to memorize non - spatial information .
Memorization is a method of learning that allows an individual to recall information verbatim .
Methods of memorizing things have been the subject of much discussion over the years with some writers , such as Cosmos --OOV-- using visual alphabets . The spacing effect shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time .
The spacing effect shows that an individual is more likely to remember a list of items when rehearsal is spaced over an extended period of time .
--OOV-- Among the vast varieties of microorganisms , relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals .
Infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect .
The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen , depends upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen .
However a host 's immune system can also cause damage to the host itself in an attempt to control the infection .
Clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as primary pathogens or as opportunistic pathogens :
One way of proving that a given disease is " infectious " , is to satisfy Koch 's postulates ( first proposed by Robert Koch ) , which demands that the infectious agent be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls , and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease .

Koch 's postulates can not be applied ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture .
For example , Treponema pallidum , the causative spirochete of syphilis , can not be cultured in vitro - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit testes .
Infectious diseases are sometimes called contagious disease when they are easily transmitted by contact with an ill person or their secretions ( e.g. , influenza ) .
Thus , a contagious disease is a subset of infectious disease that is especially infective or easily transmitted .
Thus , a contagious disease is a subset of infectious disease that is especially infective or easily transmitted .
Other types of infectious / transmissible / communicable diseases with more specialized routes of infection , such as vector transmission or sexual transmission , are usually not regarded as " contagious " , and often do not require medical isolation ( sometimes loosely called quarantine ) of victims .
However , this specialized connotation of the word " contagious " and " contagious disease " ( easy transmissibility ) is not always respected in popular use .
Infection begins when an organism successfully enters the body , grows and multiplies . This is referred to as colonization .
Most humans are not easily infected .
Those who are weak , sick , malnourished , have cancer or are diabetic have increased susceptibility to chronic or persistent infections .
Individuals who have a suppressed immune system are particularly susceptible to opportunistic infections .
Some pathogens grow within the host cells ( intracellular ) whereas others grow freely in bodily fluids .
Wound colonization refers to --OOV-- microorganisms within the wound , while in infected wounds , replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured .
Wound colonization refers to --OOV-- microorganisms within the wound , while in infected wounds , replicating organisms exist and tissue is injured .
All multicellular organisms are colonized to some degree by extrinsic organisms , and the vast majority of these exist in either a mutualistic or commensal relationship with the host .
The difference between an infection and a colonization is often only a matter of circumstance .
An example of the former is the anaerobic bacteria species , which colonizes the mammalian colon , and an example of the latter is various species of staphylococcus that exist on human skin .
Because it is normal to have bacterial colonization , it is difficult to know which chronic wounds are infected .
Despite the huge number of wounds seen in clinical practice , there are limited quality data for evaluated symptoms and signs .
A review of chronic wounds in the Journal of the American Medical Association 's " Rational Clinical Examination Series " quantified the importance of increased pain as an indicator of infection .
The review showed that the most useful finding is an increase in the level of pain [ likelihood ratio ( LR ) range , 11 - 20 ] makes infection much more likely , but the absence of pain ( negative likelihood ratio range , 0.64 - 0.88 ) does not rule out infection ( summary LR 0.64 - 0.88 ) .
Disease can arise if the host 's protective immune mechanisms are compromised and the organism inflicts damage on the host .
Microorganisms can cause tissue damage by releasing a variety of toxins or destructive enzymes .
For example , Clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles , and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis .
For example , Clostridium tetani releases a toxin that paralyzes muscles , and staphylococcus releases toxins that produce shock and sepsis .
For example , less than 5 % of individuals infected with polio develop disease .
Persistent infections occur because the body is unable to clear the organism after the initial infection .
Persistent infections are characterized by the continual presence of the infectious organism , often as latent infection with occasional recurrent relapses of active infection .
There are some viruses that can maintain a persistent infection by infecting different cells of the body .
Some viruses once acquired never leave the body .
A typical example is the herpes virus , which tends to hide in nerves and become reactivated when specific circumstances arise .
Diagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly .
In practice most minor infectious diseases such as warts , cutaneous abscesses , respiratory system infections and diarrheal diseases are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific causative agent .
In practice most minor infectious diseases such as warts , cutaneous abscesses , respiratory system infections and diarrheal diseases are diagnosed by their clinical presentation and treated without knowledge of the specific causative agent .
Given sufficient effort , all known infectious agents can be specifically identified .
The benefits of identification , however , are often greatly outweighed by the cost , as often there is no specific treatment , the cause is obvious , or the outcome of an infection is benign .
Diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by medical history and physical examination .
More detailed identification techniques involve the culture of infectious agents isolated from a patient .
Culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features , by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens , and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype .
Culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features , by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens , and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype .
Other techniques ( such as X - rays , CAT scans , PET scans or NMR ) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent .
Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease .
In a microbial culture , a growth medium is provided for a specific agent .
Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar , a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium , along with copious amounts of water .
A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony , which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a " lawn " .
In the case of viral identification , a region of dead cells results from viral growth , and is called a " plaque " .
In the absence of suitable plate culture techniques , some microbes require culture within live animals .
Bacteria such as Mycobacterium leprae and Treponema pallidum can be grown in animals , although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary .
Some viruses may be grown in embryonated eggs .
Another useful identification method is --OOV-- , or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent .
Chagas disease is the most significant example , because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent , Trypanosoma cruzi in a patient , which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis .
Another principal tool in the diagnosis of infectious disease is microscopy .
Virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely , at some point , on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent .
Samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope , and can often rapidly lead to identification .
Microscopy is often also used in conjunction with biochemical staining techniques , and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with antibody based techniques . For example , the use of antibodies made artificially fluorescent ( fluorescently labeled antibodies ) can be directed to bind to and identify a specific antigens present on a pathogen .

Staining a cell with a dye such as Giemsa stain or crystal violet allows a microscopist to describe its size , shape , internal and external components and its associations with other cells .
Two methods , the Gram stain and the acid - fast stain , are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease .
The isolation of enzymes from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease .
For example , humans can make neither RNA --OOV-- nor reverse transcriptase , and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections .
The ability of the viral protein hemagglutinin to bind red blood cells together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection , although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an enzyme and has no metabolic function .
For example , humans can make neither RNA --OOV-- nor reverse transcriptase , and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections .
Serological methods are highly sensitive , specific and often extremely rapid tests used to identify microorganisms .
These tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to bind specifically to an antigen .
The antigen , usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent , is bound by the antibody .
This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be visibly obvious in various ways , dependent upon the test .
For example , " Strep throat " is often diagnosed within minutes , and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent , S. pyogenes , that is retrieved from a patients throat with a cotton swab .
Complex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as Immunoassays .
Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal , which can be detected by some form of instrumentation .
Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen .
To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases , immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent .
Technologies based upon the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future , for several reasons .
Technologies based upon the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future , for several reasons .
First , the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified .
Second , an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease ; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease .
Third , the essential tools for directing PCR , primers , are derived from the genomes of infectious agents , and with time those genomes will be known , if they are not already .
Thus , the technological ability to detect any infectious agent rapidly and specifically are currently available .
The only remaining blockades to the use of PCR as a standard tool of diagnosis are in its cost and application , neither of which is insurmountable .
The diagnosis of a few diseases will not benefit from the development of PCR methods , such as some of the clostridial diseases ( tetanus and botulism ) .
A significant proliferation of the infectious agent does not occur , this limits the ability of PCR to detect the presence of any bacteria .
For example , in the early 1980s , prior to the appearance of AZT for the treatment of AIDS , the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples , even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options .

By understanding how the disease was transmitted , resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections .
The specific serological diagnostic identification , and later genotypic or molecular identification , of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the temporal and geographical origins of the virus , as well as a myriad of other hypothesis .
Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection .
Techniques like hand washing , wearing gowns , and wearing face masks can help prevent infections from being passed from one person to another .
Frequent hand washing remains the most important defense against the spread of unwanted organisms .
There are other forms of prevention such as avoiding the use of illicit drugs , using a condom , and having a healthy lifestyle with a balanced diet and regular exercise .

Cooking foods well and avoiding foods that have been left outside for a long time is also important .
One of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases .
Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include virulence , distance traveled by victims , and level of contagiousness .
The human strains of Ebola virus , for example , incapacitate their victims extremely quickly and kill them soon after .
Thus , the initial stage of Ebola is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging .
Also , the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances , increasing the likelihood of an epidemic .
Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of small - world networks .
In epidemics , there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals .
However , infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs .
The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method .
--OOV-- Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the foot - and - mouth virus in 2001 .
Resistance to infection ( immunity ) may be acquired following a disease , by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen , by harboring an organism with a similar structure ( --OOV-- ) , or by vaccination .
Resistance to infection ( immunity ) may be acquired following a disease , by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen , by harboring an organism with a similar structure ( --OOV-- ) , or by vaccination .
Knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for opportunistic pathogens .
There is also the phenomenon of herd immunity which offers a measure of protection to those otherwise vulnerable people when a large enough proportion of the population has acquired immunity from certain infections .
Resistance to infection ( immunity ) may be acquired following a disease , by asymptomatic carriage of the pathogen , by harboring an organism with a similar structure ( --OOV-- ) , or by vaccination .
The clearance of the pathogens , either treatment - induced or spontaneous , it can be influenced by the genetic variants carried by the individual patients .
For instance , for genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with Pegylated interferon - alpha-2a or Pegylated interferon - alpha-2b ( brand names Pegasys or PEG - Intron ) combined with ribavirin , it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human IL28B gene , encoding interferon lambda 3 , are associated with significant differences in the treatment - induced clearance of the virus .
This finding , originally reported in Nature , showed that genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more possibly to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment than others .
When infection attacks the body , anti - infective drugs can suppress the infection .
Several broad types of anti - infective drugs exist , depending on the type of organism targeted ; they include antibacterial ( antibiotic ; including antitubercular ) , antiviral , antifungal and antiparasitic ( including antiprotozoal and antihelminthic ) agents .
Depending on the severity and the type of infection , the antibiotic may be given by mouth or by injection , or may be applied topically .
Severe infections of the brain are usually treated with intravenous antibiotics .
Antibiotics work by slowing down the multiplication of bacteria or killing the bacteria .
The top three single agent / disease killers are HIV / AIDS , TB and malaria .
While the number of deaths due to nearly every disease have decreased , deaths due to HIV / AIDS have increased fourfold .
Childhood diseases include pertussis , poliomyelitis , diphtheria , measles and tetanus .
Children also make up a large percentage of lower respiratory and diarrheal deaths .
In 2012 , approximately 3.1 million people have died due to lower respiratory infections , making it the number 4 leading cause of death in the world .
The medical treatment of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of Infectious Disease and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of Epidemiology .

Generally , infections are initially diagnosed by primary care physicians or internal medicine specialists .
For example , an " uncomplicated " pneumonia will generally be treated by the internist or the pulmonologist ( lung physician ) .
The work of the infectious diseases specialist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners , as well as laboratory scientists , immunologists , bacteriologists and other specialists .
A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior .
Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area .
This may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance of other groups , which may reduce pathogen transmission , or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies that enforce a common culture .
Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior , which may reduce pathogen transmission .
Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development .
Evidence of infection in fossil remains is a subject of interest for --OOV-- , scientists who study occurrences of injuries and illness in extinct life forms .

Signs of infection have been discovered in the bones of carnivorous dinosaurs .
A skull attributed to the early carnivorous dinosaur Herrerasaurus --OOV-- exhibits pit - like wounds surrounded by swollen and porous bone .
The infections from both tyrannosaurs were received by being bitten during a fight , like the Herrerasaurus specimen .
The Heian period ( --OOV-- , Heian jidai ?
The period is named after the capital city of Heian - --OOV-- , or modern Kyōto .
) means " peace " in Japanese .
Although the Imperial House of Japan had power on the surface , the real power was in the hands of the Fujiwara clan , a powerful aristocratic family who had intermarried with the imperial family .
The Heian period is also considered the peak of the Japanese imperial court and noted for its art , especially poetry and literature .
The Heian period was preceded by the Nara period and began in 794 A.D after the movement of the capital of Japan to Heian - --OOV-- ( present day --OOV-- ) , by the 50th emperor , Emperor --OOV-- .

Nominally , sovereignty lay in the emperor but in fact power was wielded by the Fujiwara nobility .
As early as 939 A.D , Taira no Masakado threatened the authority of the central government , leading an uprising in the eastern province of Hitachi , and almost simultaneously , Fujiwara no Sumitomo rebelled in the west .

When Emperor Kammu moved the capital to Heian - --OOV-- ( Kyōto ) , which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years , he did so not only to strengthen imperial authority but also to improve his seat of government geopolitically .
Nara was abandoned after only 70 years in part due to the ascendancy of --OOV-- and the encroaching secular power of the Buddhist institutions there .

Although Kammu had abandoned universal conscription in 792 , he still waged major military offensives to subjugate the Emishi , possible descendants of the displaced Jōmon , living in northern and eastern Japan .
After making temporary gains in 794 , in 797 Kammu appointed a new commander , --OOV-- no --OOV-- , under the title Sei - i --OOV-- ( Barbarian - subduing generalissimo ) .

Following Kammu 's death in 806 and a succession struggle among his sons , two new offices were established in an effort to adjust the Taika - --OOV-- administrative structure .
The new Metropolitan Police Board replaced the largely ceremonial imperial guard units .
Through the new Emperor 's Private Office , the emperor could issue administrative edicts more directly and with more self - assurance than before .
In 838 the end of the imperial - sanctioned missions to Tang China , which had begun in 630 , marked the effective end of Chinese influence .
As the Soga clan had taken control of the throne in the sixth century , the Fujiwara by the ninth century had intermarried with the imperial family , and one of their members was the first head of the Emperor 's Private Office .

By the early Heian period , the --OOV-- had obtained legal status , and the large religious establishments sought clear titles in perpetuity , waiver of taxes , and immunity from government inspection of the --OOV-- they held .
Those people who worked the land found it advantageous to transfer title to --OOV-- holders in return for a share of the harvest .
Central control of Japan had continued to decline , and the Fujiwara , along with other great families and religious foundations , acquired ever larger --OOV-- and greater wealth during the early tenth century .
Two types of phonetic Japanese script : katakana , a simplified script that was developed by using parts of Chinese characters , was abbreviated to hiragana , a cursive syllabary with a distinct writing method that was uniquely Japanese .

Vividly colored yamato - e , Japanese style paintings of court life and stories about temples and shrines became common in the --OOV-- and late Heian periods , setting patterns for Japanese art to this day .
Land management became the primary occupation of the aristocracy , not so much because direct control by the imperial family or central government had declined but more from strong family solidarity and a lack of a sense of Japan as a single nation .
Whereas the first phase of --OOV-- development in the early Heian period had seen the opening of new lands and the granting of the use of lands to aristocrats and religious institutions , the second phase saw the growth of patrimonial " house governments , " as in the old clan system .
The --OOV-- Code lapsed , its institutions relegated to ceremonial functions .
As the most powerful family , the Fujiwara governed Japan and determined the general affairs of state , such as succession to the throne .
But as the system broke down after 792 , local power holders again became the primary source of military strength .
At that time the imperial court did not possess an army but rather relied on an organization of professional warriors composed mainly of --OOV-- , which were appointed to an individual province and --OOV-- , which were appointed over imperial circuits or for specific tasks .

Nonetheless final authority rested with the imperial court .
--OOV-- holders had access to manpower and , as they obtained improved military technology ( such as new training methods , more powerful bows , armor , horses , and superior swords ) and faced worsening local conditions in the ninth century , military service became part of --OOV-- life .
Not only the --OOV-- but also civil and religious institutions formed private guard units to protect themselves .
Gradually , the provincial upper class was transformed into a new military elite based on the ideals of the bushi ( warrior ) or samurai ( literally , one who serves ) .
Gradually , the provincial upper class was transformed into a new military elite based on the ideals of the bushi ( warrior ) or samurai ( literally , one who serves ) .
Bushi interests were diverse , cutting across old power structures to form new associations in the tenth century .
These military families gained prestige from connections to the imperial court and court - granted military titles and access to manpower .
The Fujiwara family , Taira clan , and Minamoto clan were among the most prominent families supported by the new military class .
The Fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of Emperor Go - --OOV-- ( 1068 - 1073 ) , the first emperor not born of a Fujiwara mother since the ninth century .
The Fujiwara controlled the throne until the reign of Emperor Go - --OOV-- ( 1068 - 1073 ) , the first emperor not born of a Fujiwara mother since the ninth century .
Go - Sanjo also established the In - no - cho ( --OOV-- Office of the Cloistered Emperor ) , which was held by a succession of emperors who abdicated to devote themselves to behind - the - scenes governance , or insei .
The In - no - cho filled the void left by the decline of Fujiwara power .
In time , many of the Fujiwara were replaced , mostly by members of the rising Minamoto family .
While the Fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions , the insei system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne .
The period from 1086 to 1156 was the age of supremacy of the In - no - cho and of the rise of the military class throughout the country .
Fujiwara no --OOV-- sided with the retired emperor in a violent battle in 1156 against the heir apparent , who was supported by the Taira and Minamoto ( --OOV-- Rebellion ) .

Shingon , brought to Japan by the monk Kūkai , emphasizes Esoteric Buddhism .
An important element of Tendai doctrine was the suggestion that enlightenment was accessible to " every creature " .
Nobles and ladies - in - waiting were expected to be well versed in the art of writing poetry as a mark of their status .
The Japanese of this period believed handwriting could reflect the condition of a person 's soul : therefore , poor or hasty writing could be considered a sign of poor breeding .

The lyrics of the modern Japanese national anthem , Kimi ga Yo , were written in the Heian period , as was The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu , one of the first novels ever written .
The famous Japanese poem known as the Iroha ( --OOV-- ) , of uncertain authorship , was also written during the Heian period .
Murasaki Shikibu 's contemporary and rival Sei --OOV-- 's revealing observations and musings as an attendant in the Empress ' court were recorded collectively as The Pillow Book in the 990s , which revealed the quotidian capital lifestyle .
The control of rice fields provided a key source of income for families such as the Fujiwara and were a fundamental base for their power .
The aristocratic beneficiaries of Heian culture , the --OOV-- ( --OOV-- " Good People " ) numbered about five thousand in a land of perhaps five million .
By the year 1000 the government no longer knew how to issue currency and money was gradually disappearing .
Instead of a fully realised system of money circulation , rice was the primary unit of exchange .
The major Buddhist temples in Heian - --OOV-- and Nara also made use of the --OOV-- .
The Fujiwara rulers failed to maintain adequate police forces , which left robbers free to prey on travelers .
The establishment of branches rurally and integration of some Shinto shrines within these temple networks reflects a greater " organizational dynamism " .
The game Total War : Shogun 2 has the Rise of the Samurai expansion pack as downloadable campaign .
The player is able to choose one of the most powerful families of Japan at the time , the Taira , Minamoto or Fujiwara ; each family fielding two branches for a total of six playable clans .
It allows the player to make their own version of the --OOV-- War which happened during the Heian period .

Among the characters not originally intended for Unicode are rarely used Kanji or Chinese characters , many of which are part of personal and place names , making them rarely used , but much more essential than envisioned in the original architecture of Unicode .
Among the characters not originally intended for Unicode are rarely used Kanji or Chinese characters , many of which are part of personal and place names , making them rarely used , but much more essential than envisioned in the original architecture of Unicode .
This increased the Unicode --OOV-- to over a million code points , which allowed for the encoding of many historic scripts ( e.g. , Egyptian Hieroglyphs ) and thousands of rarely used or obsolete characters that had not been anticipated as needing encoding .
The major categories are : Letter , Mark , Number , Punctuation , Symbol , Separator and Other .
The General Category is not useful for every use , since legacy encodings have used multiple characteristics per single code point .
E.g. , --OOV-- < --OOV-- > Line feed ( LF ) in ASCII is both a control and a formatting separator ; in Unicode the General Category is " Other , Control " .
Each code point has a single General Category property .
Within these categories , there are subdivisions .
Code points in the range --OOV-- ( 1,024 code points ) are known as high - surrogate code points , and code points in the range --OOV-- ( 1,024 code points ) are known as low - surrogate code points .
Code points in the range --OOV-- ( 1,024 code points ) are known as high - surrogate code points , and code points in the range --OOV-- ( 1,024 code points ) are known as low - surrogate code points .
A high - surrogate code point ( also known as a leading surrogate ) followed by a low - surrogate code point ( also known as a trailing surrogate ) together form a surrogate pair used in UTF-16 to represent 1,048,576 code points outside BMP .

Thus the range of code points that are available for use as characters is --OOV-- and --OOV-- ( --OOV-- code points ) .
For example , a Latin small letter " i " with an ogonek , a dot above , and an acute accent , which is required in Lithuanian , is represented by the character sequence --OOV-- , --OOV-- , --OOV-- .
Unicode encodes characters by associating an abstract character with a particular code point .
However , not all abstract characters are encoded as a single Unicode character , and some abstract characters may be represented in Unicode by a sequence of two or more characters .
This immutability has been guaranteed since Unicode version 2.0 by the Name Stability policy .

Unicode and ISO / IEC 10646 function equivalently as character encodings , but The Unicode Standard contains much more information for implementers , covering — in depth — topics such as bitwise encoding , collation and rendering .
The two standards do use slightly different terminology .
Unlike the previous major version printings of the Standard , the print - on - demand core specification does not include any code charts or standard annexes , but the entire standard , including the core specification , will still remain freely available on the Unicode website .
The Consortium first published The Unicode Standard ( ISBN 0 - 321 - 18578 - 1 ) in 1991 and continues to develop standards based on that original work .
The latest version of the standard , Unicode 8.0 , was released in June 2015 and is available from the consortium 's website .
The last of the major versions ( versions --OOV-- ) to be published in book form was Unicode 5.0 ( ISBN 0 - 321 - 48091 - 0 ) , but since Unicode 6.0 the full text of the standard is no longer being published in book form .
In 2012 , however , it was announced that only the core specification for Unicode version 6.1 would be made available as a --OOV-- print - on - demand paperback .

Unicode defines two mapping methods : the Unicode Transformation Format ( UTF ) encodings , and the Universal Coded Character Set ( UCS ) encodings .
Unicode defines two mapping methods : the Unicode Transformation Format ( UTF ) encodings , and the Universal Coded Character Set ( UCS ) encodings .
The numbers in the names of the encodings indicate the number of bits per code value ( for UTF encodings ) or the number of bytes per code value ( for UCS encodings ) .
UTF-8 and UTF-16 are probably the most commonly used encodings .
Unicode defines two mapping methods : the Unicode Transformation Format ( UTF ) encodings , and the Universal Coded Character Set ( UCS ) encodings .
The UCS-2 and UTF-16 encodings specify the Unicode Byte Order Mark ( BOM ) for use at the beginnings of text files , which may be used for byte ordering detection ( or byte endianness detection ) .
The UCS-2 and UTF-16 encodings specify the Unicode Byte Order Mark ( BOM ) for use at the beginnings of text files , which may be used for byte ordering detection ( or byte endianness detection ) .
The BOM , code point U+FEFF has the important property of unambiguity on byte reorder , regardless of the Unicode encoding used ; --OOV-- ( the result of byte - swapping U+FEFF ) does not equate to a legal character , and U+FEFF in other places , other than the beginning of text , conveys the zero - width non - break space ( a character with no appearance and no effect other than preventing the formation of ligatures ) .

However RFC 3629 , the UTF-8 standard , recommends that byte order marks be forbidden in protocols using UTF-8 , but discusses the cases where this may not be possible .
However RFC 3629 , the UTF-8 standard , recommends that byte order marks be forbidden in protocols using UTF-8 , but discusses the cases where this may not be possible .
In addition , the large restriction on possible patterns in UTF-8 ( for instance there can not be any lone bytes with the high bit set ) means that it should be possible to distinguish UTF-8 from other character encodings without relying on the BOM .
UTF-32 is widely used as an internal representation of text in programs ( as opposed to stored or transmitted text ) , since every Unix operating system that uses the gcc compilers to generate software uses it as the standard " wide character " encoding .
Some programming languages , such as Seed7 , use UTF-32 as internal representation for strings and characters .
Recent versions of the Python programming language ( beginning with 2.2 ) may also be configured to use UTF-32 as the representation for Unicode strings , effectively disseminating such encoding in high - level coded software .
Unicode also contains precomposed versions of most letter / diacritic combinations in normal use .
For example , é can be represented in Unicode as --OOV-- ( LATIN SMALL LETTER E ) followed by --OOV-- ( COMBINING ACUTE ACCENT ) , but it can also be represented as the precomposed character --OOV-- ( LATIN SMALL LETTER E WITH ACUTE ) .

Still , most of those ideographs comprise simpler elements ( often called radicals in English ) , so in principle , Unicode could have decomposed them , as it did with Hangul .
However , attempts to do this for character encoding have stumbled over the fact that ideographs do not decompose as simply or as regularly as Hangul does .
This would have greatly reduced the number of required code points , while allowing the display of virtually every conceivable ideograph ( which might do away with some of the problems caused by Han unification ) .
The rules governing ligature formation can be quite complex , requiring special script - shaping technologies such as ACE ( Arabic Calligraphic Engine by --OOV-- in the 1980s and used to generate all the Arabic examples in the printed editions of the Unicode Standard ) , which became the proof of concept for OpenType ( by Adobe and Microsoft ) , Graphite ( by SIL International ) , or AAT ( by Apple ) .

Instructions are also embedded in fonts to tell the operating system how to properly output different character sequences .
Real stacking is impossible , but can be approximated in limited cases ( for example , Thai top - combining vowels and tone marks can just be at different heights to start with ) .
A simple solution to the placement of combining marks or diacritics is assigning the marks a width of zero and placing the glyph itself to the left or right of the left --OOV-- ( depending on the direction of the script they are intended to be used with ) .
Several subsets of Unicode are standardized : Microsoft Windows since Windows NT 4.0 supports --OOV-- with 652 characters , which is considered to support all contemporary European languages using the Latin , Greek , or Cyrillic script .
Other standardized subsets of Unicode include the Multilingual European Subsets : --OOV-- ( Latin scripts only , 335 characters ) , --OOV-- ( Latin , Greek and Cyrillic 1062 characters ) and --OOV-- & --OOV-- ( two larger subsets , not shown here ) .
Note that --OOV-- includes every character in --OOV-- and --OOV-- .

Unicode has become the dominant scheme for internal processing and storage of text .
Unicode is available on Windows 95 through Microsoft Layer for Unicode , as well as on its descendants , Windows 98 and Windows ME .
Early adopters tended to use UCS-2 ( the fixed - width two - byte precursor to UTF-16 ) and later moved to UTF-16 ( the variable - width current standard ) , as this was the least disruptive way to add support for non - BMP characters .
Although a great deal of text is still stored in legacy encodings , Unicode is used almost exclusively for building new information processing systems .
For email transmission of Unicode the UTF-8 character set and the Base64 or the Quoted - printable transfer encoding are recommended , depending on whether much of the message consists of ASCII - characters .
The details of the two different mechanisms are specified in the MIME standards and generally are hidden from users of email software .
MIME defines two different mechanisms for encoding non - ASCII characters in email , depending on whether the characters are in email headers ( such as the " Subject : " ) , or in the text body of the message ; in both cases , the original character set is identified as well as a transfer encoding .
Thousands of fonts exist on the market , but fewer than a dozen fonts — sometimes described as " pan - Unicode " fonts — attempt to support the majority of Unicode 's character repertoire .

Instead , Unicode - based fonts typically focus on supporting only basic ASCII and particular scripts or sets of characters or symbols .
In terms of the newline , Unicode introduced --OOV-- LINE SEPARATOR and --OOV-- PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR .
In terms of the newline , Unicode introduced --OOV-- LINE SEPARATOR and --OOV-- PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR .
This is achieved with the Cocoa text system in Mac OS X and also with W3C XML and HTML recommendations .
In this approach every possible newline character is converted internally to a common newline ( which one does not really matter since it is an internal operation just for rendering ) .
Unicode has been criticized for failing to separately encode older and alternative forms of kanji which , critics argue , complicates the processing of ancient Japanese and uncommon Japanese names .
Unification of glyphs leads to the perception that the languages themselves , not just the basic character representation , are being --OOV-- needed ] There have been several attempts to create alternative encodings that preserve the stylistic differences between Chinese , Japanese , and Korean characters in opposition to Unicode 's policy of Han unification .
Unification of glyphs leads to the perception that the languages themselves , not just the basic character representation , are being --OOV-- needed ] There have been several attempts to create alternative encodings that preserve the stylistic differences between Chinese , Japanese , and Korean characters in opposition to Unicode 's policy of Han unification .
For example , the Advanced Typographic tables of OpenType permit one of a number of alternative glyph representations to be selected when performing the character to glyph mapping process .
In this case , information can be provided within plain text to designate which alternate character form to select .
Modern font technology provides a means to address the practical issue of needing to depict a unified Han character in terms of a collection of alternative glyph representations , in the form of Unicode variation sequences .
Unicode was designed to provide code - point - by - code - point round - trip format conversion to and from any preexisting character encodings , so that text files in older character sets can be naïvely converted to Unicode , and then back and get back the same file .
This is most pronounced in the three different encoding forms for Korean Hangul .
Since version 3.0 , any precomposed characters that can be represented by a combining sequence of already existing characters can no longer be added to the standard in order to preserve interoperability between software using different versions of Unicode .
Injective mappings must be provided between characters in existing legacy character sets and characters in Unicode to facilitate conversion to Unicode and allow interoperability with legacy software .
Lack of consistency in various mappings between earlier Japanese encodings such as Shift - JIS or EUC - JP and Unicode led to round - trip format conversion mismatches , particularly the mapping of the character JIS X 0208 ' ～ ' ( 1 - 33 , WAVE DASH ) , heavily used in legacy database data , to either --OOV-- ～ fullwidth TILDE ( in Microsoft Windows ) or --OOV-- --OOV-- WAVE DASH ( other vendors ) .

Indic scripts such as Tamil and Devanagari are each allocated only 128 code points , matching the ISCII standard .
The correct rendering of Unicode Indic text requires transforming the stored logical order characters into visual order and the forming of ligatures ( aka conjuncts ) out of components .
Indic scripts such as Tamil and Devanagari are each allocated only 128 code points , matching the ISCII standard .
This complication is due to Unicode inheriting the Thai Industrial Standard 620 , which worked in the same way , and was the way in which Thai had always been written on keyboards .
Thai alphabet support has been criticized for its ordering of Thai characters .
Characters with diacritical marks can generally be represented either as a single precomposed character or as a decomposed sequence of a base letter plus one or more non - spacing marks .
Unicode characters that map to precomposed glyphs can be used in many cases , thus avoiding the problem , but where no precomposed character has been encoded the problem can often be solved by using a specialist Unicode font such as Charis SIL that uses Graphite , OpenType , or AAT technologies for advanced rendering features .
Similarly , --OOV-- , as needed in the romanization of Indic , will often be placed --OOV-- needed ] .
Characters with diacritical marks can generally be represented either as a single precomposed character or as a decomposed sequence of a base letter plus one or more non - spacing marks .
For example , --OOV-- ( precomposed e with macron and acute above ) and --OOV-- ( e followed by the combining macron above and combining acute above ) should be rendered identically , both appearing as an e with a macron and acute accent , but in practice , their appearance may vary depending upon what rendering engine and fonts are being used to display the characters .

Gymnasts sprint down a runway , which is a maximum of 25 meters in length , before hurdling onto a spring board .
The body position is maintained while " punching " ( blocking using only a shoulder movement ) the vaulting platform .
Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run , the length of the hurdle , the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle , the kinesthetic awareness in the air , and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults .
In advanced gymnastics , multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing .

In advanced gymnastics , multiple twists and somersaults may be added before landing .
Successful vaults depend on the speed of the run , the length of the hurdle , the power the gymnast generates from the legs and shoulder girdle , the kinesthetic awareness in the air , and the speed of rotation in the case of more difficult and complex vaults .
According to FIG rules , only women compete in rhythmic gymnastics .

Aesthetic Group Gymnastics ( AGG ) was developed from the Finnish " --OOV-- " .
It differs from Rhythmic Gymnastics in that body movement is large and continuous and teams are larger ' Athletes do not use apparatus in international AGG competitions compared to Rhythmic Gymnastics where ball , ribbon , hoop and clubs are used on the floor area .

The sport requires physical qualities such as flexibility , balance , speed , strength , coordination and sense of rhythm where movements of the body are emphasized through the flow , expression and aesthetic appeal .
The International Federation of Aesthetic Group Gymnastics ( --OOV-- ) was established in 2003 .
This apparatus may be made of hemp or a synthetic material which retains the qualities of lightness and suppleness .
Its length is in proportion to the size of the gymnast .
One or two knots at each end are for keeping hold of the rope while doing the routine . At the ends ( to the exclusion of all other parts of the rope ) an anti - slip material , either coloured or neutral may cover a maximum of 10 cm ( 3.94 in ) .
The rope must be coloured , either all or partially and may either be of a uniform diameter or be progressively thicker in the center provided that this thickening is of the same material as the rope .
In 2011 , the FIG decided to nullify the use of rope in rhythmic gymnastic competitions .
The Federation of International Gymnastics ( FIG ) was founded in Liege in 1881 .

By the end of the nineteenth century , men 's gymnastics competition was popular enough to be included in the first " modern " Olympic Games in 1896 .
These games were held in 1928 , in Amsterdam .

In the vaulting events , gymnasts sprint down a 25 metres ( 82 ft ) runway , jump onto a spring filled board or perform a roundoff , or handspring entry onto a springboard ( --OOV-- take - off segment ) , land momentarily , inverted on the hands on the vaulting horse , or vaulting table ( pre flight segment ) , then propel themselves forward or backward , off of this platform to a two footed landing ( post flight segment ) .

Every gymnast starts at a different point on the vault runway depending on their height and strength .
A round - off entry vault , called a Yurchenko , is the most common vault in elite level gymnastics .
When performing a Yurchenko , gymnasts " round - off " so hands are on the runway while the feet land on the springboard ( --OOV-- ) .
A gymnast 's score comes from deductions taken from their start value .
The start value of a routine is based on the difficulty of the elements the gymnast attempts and whether or not the gymnast meets composition requirements .
The composition requirements are different for each apparatus ; this score is called the D score .
Deductions in execution and artistry are taken from 10.0 .
Since 2007 , the scoring system has changed by adding bonus plus the execution and then adding those two together to get the final score .
The technical rules for the Japanese version of men 's rhythmic gymnastics came around the 1970s .
For individuals , only four types of apparatus are used : the double rings , the stick , the rope , and the clubs .

The word gymnastics derives from the common Greek adjective --OOV-- ( --OOV-- ) meaning " naked " , by way of the related verb --OOV-- ( --OOV-- ) , whose meaning is to train naked " , " train in gymnastic exercise " , generally " to train , to exercise " .

The verb had this meaning , because athletes in ancient times exercised and competed without clothing .
It came into use in the 1570s , from Latin --OOV-- , from Greek --OOV-- " fond of or skilled in bodily exercise , " from --OOV-- " to exercise or train " ( see gymnasium ) .
By 1954 , Olympic Games apparatus and events for both men and women had been standardized in modern format , and uniform grading structures ( including a point system from 1 to 15 ) had been agreed upon .

A typical pommel horse exercise involves both single leg and double leg work .
Single leg skills are generally found in the form of scissors , an element often done on the pommels .
Double leg work however , is the main staple of this event .
Routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount , either by swinging his body over the horse , or landing after a handstand .
Routines end when the gymnast performs a dismount , either by swinging his body over the horse , or landing after a handstand .
In a tumbling pass , dismount or vault , landing is the final phase , following take off and flight --OOV-- This is a critical skill in terms of execution in competition scores , general performance , and injury occurrence .
These injuries commonly occur at the lower extremities such as : cartilage lesions , ligament tears , and bone bruises / fractures .
To avoid such injuries , and to receive a high performance score , proper technique must be used by the gymnast .
" --OOV-- A successful landing in gymnastics is classified as soft , meaning the knee and hip joints are at greater than 63 degrees of flexion .
Individual routines in trampolining involve a build - up phase during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height , followed by a sequence of ten bounces without pause during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial skills .
Individual routines in trampolining involve a build - up phase during which the gymnast jumps repeatedly to achieve height , followed by a sequence of ten bounces without pause during which the gymnast performs a sequence of aerial skills .
Routines are marked out of a maximum score of 10 points .
Additional points ( with no maximum at the highest levels of competition ) can be earned depending on the difficulty of the moves and the length of time taken to complete the ten skills which is an indication of the average height of the jumps .
In high level competitions , there are two preliminary routines , one which has only two moves scored for difficulty and one where the athlete is free to perform any routine .
On the uneven bars , the gymnast performs a routine on two horizontal bars set at different heights .
These bars are made of fiberglass covered in wood laminate , to prevent them from breaking .
In the past , bars were made of wood , but the bars were prone to breaking , providing an incentive to switch to newer technologies .
They 've been moved increasingly further apart , allowing gymnasts to perform swinging , circling , transitional , and release moves , that may pass over , under , and between the two bars .
Gymnasts often mount the Uneven Bars using a springboard , or a small mat .
A higher flight phase results in a higher vertical ground reaction force .
Vertical ground reaction force represents external force which the gymnasts have to overcome with their muscle force and has an impact on the gymnasts linear and angular momentum .
Another important variable that affects linear and angular momentum is time the landing takes Gymnasts can alter the shape of the area by increasing the time taken to perform the landing .
Aerobic gymnastics ( formally Sport Aerobics ) involves the performance of routines by individuals , pairs , trios or groups up to 6 people , emphasizing strength , flexibility , and aerobic fitness rather than acrobatic or balance skills .

Routines generally last --OOV-- seconds depending on age of participant and routine category .
They perform synchronized , choreographed routines .
Troupes may consist of both genders and are not separated into age divisions .
The largest general gymnastics exhibition is the quadrennial World Gymnaestrada which was first held in 1939 .
In 1984 Gymnastics for All was officially recognized first as a Sport Program by the FIG ( International Gymnastic Federation ) , and subsequently by national gymnastic federations worldwide with participants that now number 30 million .

Gymnastics is a sport involving the performance of exercises requiring strength , flexibility , balance and control .
Internationally , all events are governed by the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique ( FIG ) .
Each country has its own national governing body ( BIW ) affiliated to FIG .
Competitive artistic gymnastics is the best known of the gymnastic events .
It typically involves the women 's events of vault , uneven bars , balance beam , and floor exercise . Men 's events are floor exercise , pommel horse , still rings , vault , parallel bars , and the high bar .
In the late --OOV-- and early nineteenth - century Germany , three pioneer physical educators – Johann Friedrich --OOV-- ( --OOV-- ) and Friedrich Ludwig Jahn ( --OOV-- ) – created exercises for boys and young men on apparatus they had designed that ultimately led to what is considered modern gymnastics .

Don Francisco Amorós y --OOV-- , was born on February 19 , 1770 in Valence and died on August 8 , 1848 in Paris .
Jahn promoted the use of parallel bars , rings and high bar in international competition .
In 2006 , FIG introduced a new points system for Artistic gymnastics in which scores are no longer limited to 10 points .
Unlike the old code of points , there are two separate scores , an execution score and a difficulty score .
Unlike the old code of points , there are two separate scores , an execution score and a difficulty score .
A fall , on or off the event , is a 1.00 deduction , in elite level gymnastics .
The gymnast 's difficulty score is based on what elements they perform and is subject to change if they do not perform or complete all the skills , or they do not connect a skill meant to be connected to another .
Today , the floor event occurs on a carpeted 12 m × 12 m square , usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood , which is supported by springs or foam blocks generally called a " spring " floor .
In the past , the floor exercise event was executed on the bare floor or mats such as wrestling mats .
Today , the floor event occurs on a carpeted 12 m × 12 m square , usually consisting of hard foam over a layer of plywood , which is supported by springs or foam blocks generally called a " spring " floor .
Gymnasts perform a choreographed routine up to 90 seconds in the floor exercise event ; Depending on the level , they may choose their own , or , if known as a " compulsory gymnast , " default music must be played .
In tumbling , athletes perform an explosive series of flips and twists down a sprung tumbling track .
Tumbling was originally contested as one of the events in Men 's Artistic Gymnastics at the 1932 Summer Olympics , and in 1955 and 1959 at the Pan American Games .
Since the recognition of Trampoline and Acrobatic Gymnastics as FIG disciplines in 1999 , official Tumbling competitions are only allowed as an event in Trampoline gymnastics meets .

Men 's rhythmic gymnastics is related to both Men 's artistic gymnastics and wushu martial arts .
It emerged in Japan from stick gymnastics .
Stick gymnastics has been taught and performed for many years with the aim of improving physical strength and health .
Male athletes are judged on some of the same physical abilities and skills as their female counterparts , such as hand / body - eye co - ordination , but tumbling , strength , power , and martial arts skills are the main focus , as opposed to flexibility and dance in women 's rhythmic gymnastics .
As of --OOV-- ] , there were 1000 men 's rhythmic gymnasts in --OOV-- needed ]
Although the format was capable of offering higher - quality video and audio than its consumer rivals , the VHS and Betamax videocassette systems , LaserDisc never managed to gain widespread use in North America , largely due to high costs for the players and video titles themselves and the inability to record TV programming .

Its superior video and audio quality did make it a somewhat popular choice among videophiles and film enthusiasts during its lifespan .
By contrast , the format was much more popular in Japan and in the more affluent regions of Southeast Asia , such as Hong Kong , Singapore , and Malaysia , being the prevalent rental video medium in Hong Kong during the 1990s .
LaserDisc was first available on the market , in Atlanta , Georgia , on December 15 , 1978 , two years after the introduction of the VHS VCR , and four years before the introduction of the CD ( which is based on laser disc technology ) .

By the early 2000s , LaserDisc was completely replaced by DVD in the North American retail marketplace , as neither players nor software were then produced .
It was chosen by the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) for the BBC Domesday Project in the mid-1980s , a school - based project to commemorate 900 years since the original Domesday Book in England .

The format has retained some popularity among American collectors , and to a greater degree in Japan , where the format was better supported and more prevalent during its life .
The standard home video LaserDisc was 30 cm ( 12 in ) in diameter and made up of two single - sided aluminum discs layered in plastic .
In true digital media the pits , or their edges , directly represent 1s and 0s of a binary digital information stream .
Early LaserDiscs featured in 1978 were entirely analog but the format evolved to incorporate digital stereo sound in CD format ( sometimes with a TOSlink or coax output to feed an external DAC ) , and later multi - channel formats such as Dolby Digital and DTS .
--OOV-- was introduced in 1985 with a total playback capacity per side of 55 minutes 5 seconds , reducing the video capacity to resolve bandwidth issues with the inclusion of Digital Audio .
Several titles released between 1985 and 1987 were analog audio only due to the length of the title and the desire to keep the film on one disc ( e.g. , Back to the Future ) .
By 1987 , Pioneer had overcome the technical challenges and was able to once again encode in --OOV-- , allowing a total of 60 minutes 5 seconds .
There are not any known uses of this format on the consumer market .
PAL discs could carry one pair of audio tracks , either analog or digital and the digital tracks on a PAL disc were 16-bit 44.1 kHz as on a CD ; in the UK , the term " LaserVision " is used to refer to discs with analog sound , while " LaserDisc " is used for those with digital audio .
Dolby Digital ( also called AC-3 ) and DTS — which are now common on DVD titles — first became available on LaserDisc , and Star Wars : Episode I – The Phantom Menace ( 1999 ) which was released on LaserDisc in Japan , is among the first home video releases ever to include 6.1 channel Dolby Digital EX Surround . Unlike DVDs , which carry Dolby Digital audio in digital form , LaserDiscs store Dolby Digital in a frequency modulated form within a track normally used for analog audio .

By the late 1990s with LaserDisc players and disc sales declining due to DVD 's growing popularity the AV receiver manufacturers removed the demodulator circuit .
In the mid to late 1990s many higher - end AV receivers included the demodulator circuit specifically for the LaserDisc players RF modulated Dolby Digital AC-3 signal .
Another type marketed by Onkyo and others converted the RF AC-3 signal to 6-channel analog audio .
At least where the digital audio tracks were concerned , the sound quality was unsurpassed at the time compared to consumer videotape , but the quality of the analog soundtracks varied greatly depending on the disc and , sometimes , the player .
Many early and lower - end LD players had poor analog audio components , and many early discs had poorly mastered analog audio tracks , making digital soundtracks in any form most desirable to serious enthusiasts .
Later analog discs also applied CX Noise Reduction , which improved the signal - noise ratio of their audio .
Early DiscoVision and LaserDisc titles lacked the digital audio option , but many of those movies received digital sound in later re - issues by Universal , and the quality of analog audio tracks generally got far better as time went on .
A disc that included AC-3 audio forfeited the right analog audio channel to the modulated AC-3 RF stream .
If the player did not have an AC-3 output available , the next most attractive playback option would be the digital Dolby Surround or stereo audio tracks .
Such a player will happily play the analog audio tracks verbatim , resulting in garbage ( static ) output in the right channel .
Many 1990s A / V receivers combine the AC-3 decoder and DTS decoder logic , but an integrated AC-3 demodulator is rare both in LaserDisc players and in later A / V receivers .
Only one 5.1 surround sound option exists on a given LaserDisc ( either Dolby Digital or DTS ) , so if surround sound is desired , the disc must be matched to the capabilities of the playback equipment ( LD Player and Receiver / Decoder ) by the purchaser .
Many 1990s A / V receivers combine the AC-3 decoder and DTS decoder logic , but an integrated AC-3 demodulator is rare both in LaserDisc players and in later A / V receivers .
PAL LaserDiscs have a slightly longer playing time than NTSC discs , but have fewer audio options .
PAL discs only have two audio tracks , consisting of either two analog - only tracks on older PAL LDs , or two digital - only tracks on newer discs .

In March 1984 , Pioneer introduced the first consumer player with a solid - state laser , the --OOV-- .
It was also the first LD player to load from the front and not the top .
In March 1984 , Pioneer introduced the first consumer player with a solid - state laser , the --OOV-- .
After Pioneer released the --OOV-- , gas lasers were no longer used in consumer players , despite their advantages , although Philips continued to use gas lasers in their industrial units until 1985 .
During its development , MCA , which co - owned the technology , referred to it as the Optical Videodisc System , " Reflective Optical Videodisc " or " Laser Optical Videodisc " , depending on the document ; changing the name once in 1969 to Disco - Vision and then again in 1978 to DiscoVision ( without the hyphen ) , which became the official spelling .

Philips ' preferred name for the format was " VLP " , after the Dutch words Video --OOV-- - Plaat ( " Video long - play disc " ) , which in English - speaking countries stood for Video Long - Play .
The first consumer player , the Magnavox --OOV-- even had the VLP logo on the player .
The LaserVision Association , made up of MCA , Universal - Pioneer , IBM , and Philips / Magnavox , was formed to standardize the technical specifications of the format ( which had been causing problems for the consumer market ) and finally named the system officially as " LaserVision " .

A 1984 Ray Charles ad for the --OOV-- player bore the term " Pioneer LaserDisc brand videodisc player " .
During the early years , MCA also manufactured discs for other companies including Paramount , Disney and Warner Bros. Some of them added their own names to the disc jacket to signify that the movie was not owned by MCA .
An MCA release of Universal 's Howard the Duck , sees only the start credits shown in widescreen before changing to 4:3 for the rest of the film .
Also , the LaserDisc release of E.T. the Extra - Terrestrial is the only format to include the cut scene of Harrison Ford playing the part of the school headmaster telling off Elliott for letting the frogs free in the biology class .
One Universal / Columbia co - production issued by MCA Disco Vision in both CAV and CLV versions , The Electric Horseman , is still not available in any other home video format with its original score intact ; even the most recent DVD release has had substantial music replacements of both instrumental score and Willie Nelson 's songs .
It featured a far sharper picture with a horizontal resolution of 425 TVL lines for NTSC and 440 TVL lines for PAL discs , while VHS featured only 240 TVL lines with NTSC .
LaserDisc had a number of advantages over VHS .
LaserDisc had a number of advantages over VHS .
LaserDiscs were initially cheaper than videocassettes to manufacture , because they lacked the moving parts and plastic outer shell that are necessary for VHS tapes to work , and the duplication process was much simpler .
A VHS cassette has at least 14 parts including the actual tape while LaserDisc has one part with five or six layers .
However , by the end of the 1980s , average disc - pressing prices were over $ 5.00 per two - sided disc , due to the large amount of plastic material and the costly glass - mastering process needed to make the metal stamper mechanisms .
Due to the larger volume of demand , videocassettes quickly became much cheaper to duplicate , costing as little as $ 1.00 by the beginning of the 1990s .
LaserDiscs potentially had a much longer lifespan than videocassettes .
By contrast , a VHS tape held all of its picture and sound information on the tape in a magnetic coating which is in contact with the spinning heads on the head drum , causing progressive wear with each use ( though later in VHS 's lifespan , engineering improvements allowed tapes to be made and played back without contact ) .

On DVDs , data is stored in the form of digital blocks which make up each independent frame .
LaserDisc was a composite video format : the luminance ( black and white ) and chrominance ( color ) information were transmitted in one signal , separated by the receiver .
Depending upon which format is used , this can result in far higher fidelity , particularly at strong color borders or regions of high detail ( especially if there is moderate movement in the picture ) and low - contrast details like skin tones , where comb filters almost inevitably smudge some detail .

As the LaserDisc format is not digitally encoded and does not make use of compression techniques , it is immune to video macroblocking ( most visible as blockiness during high motion sequences ) or contrast banding ( subtle visible lines in gradient areas , such as out - of - focus backgrounds , skies , or light casts from spotlights ) that can be caused by the MPEG-2 encoding process as video is prepared for DVD .

Unlike many DVD players , the transport mechanism always obeys commands from the user : pause , fast - forward , and fast - reverse commands are always accepted ( barring , of course , malfunctions ) .
There were no " User Prohibited Options " where content protection code instructs the player to refuse commands to skip a specific part ( such as fast forwarding through copyright warnings ) .

LaserDisc players can provide a great degree of control over the playback process .
Some newer DVD players feature a --OOV-- algorithm , which alleviates this problem by continuing to play the disc , filling in unreadable areas of the picture with blank space or a frozen frame of the last readable image and sound .
A 1 in ( 3 cm ) scratch on a DVD will probably cause more problems than a 1 in ( 3 cm ) scratch on a LaserDisc , but a fingerprint taking up 1 % of the area of a DVD would almost certainly cause fewer problems than a similar mark covering 1 % of the surface of a --OOV-- needed ]
LaserDisc players , when working in full analog , recover from such errors faster than DVD players .
Similar to the CD versus LP sound quality debates common in the audiophile community , some videophiles argue that LaserDisc maintains a " smoother " , more " film - like " , natural image while DVD still looks slightly more artificial .
However , the video signal - to - noise ratio and bandwidth of LaserDisc are substantially less than that of DVDs , making DVDs appear sharper and clearer to most viewers .

The vertical blanking interval , where the Macrovision signal would be implemented , was also used for the internal timing on LaserDisc players , so test discs with Macrovision would not play at all .
There was never a push to redesign the format despite the obvious potential for piracy due to its relatively small market share .
It was claimed that Macrovision 's --OOV-- protection could not be applied to LaserDisc , due to the format 's design .
LaserDisc 's support for multiple audio tracks allowed for vast supplemental materials to be included on - disc and made it the first available format for " Special Edition " releases ; the 1984 Criterion Collection edition of Citizen Kane is generally credited as being the first " Special Edition " release to home --OOV-- needed ] and for setting the standard by which future SE discs were measured .

After one side was finished playing , a disc has to be flipped over in order to continue watching a movie , and some titles fill two or more discs .
One exception to this rule is the Pioneer LD - W1 , which features two disc platters .
The space - consuming analog video signal of a LaserDisc limited playback duration to 30 minutes ( CAV ) or 60 minutes ( CLV ) per side because of the hardware manufacturer 's refusal to reduce line count for increased playtime .
The space - consuming analog video signal of a LaserDisc limited playback duration to 30 minutes ( CAV ) or 60 minutes ( CLV ) per side because of the hardware manufacturer 's refusal to reduce line count for increased playtime .
Because of this , slight dust and scratches on the disc surface can result in read - errors which cause various video quality problems : glitches , streaks , bursts of static , or momentary picture interruptions .
In contrast , the digital MPEG-2 format information used on DVDs has built - in error correction which ensures that the signal from a damaged disc will remain identical to that from a perfect disc right up until the point at which damage to the disc surface is so substantial that it prevents the laser from being able to identify usable data .
The analog information encoded on LaserDiscs does not include any form of built - in checksum or error correction .
The issue can arise when the laser optical pickup assembly within the player is out of alignment or because the disc is damaged or excessively warped , but it could also occur even with a properly functioning player and a factory - new disc , depending on electrical and mechanical alignment problems .
In addition , LaserDisc videos sometimes exhibit a problem known as " crosstalk " .
During a change in speed , the optical pickup inside the player might read video information from a track adjacent to the intended one , causing data from the two tracks to " cross " ; the extra video information picked up from that second track shows up as distortion in the picture which looks reminiscent of swirling " barber poles " or rolling lines of static .
Assuming the player 's optical pickup is in proper working order , crosstalk distortion normally does not occur during playback of CAV format LaserDiscs , as the rotational speed never varies .
Assuming the player 's optical pickup is in proper working order , crosstalk distortion normally does not occur during playback of CAV format LaserDiscs , as the rotational speed never varies .
One such problem is " laser lock " , where the player reads the same two fields for a given frame over and over again , causing the picture to look frozen as if the movie were paused .
Another significant issue unique to LaserDisc is one involving the inconsistency of playback quality between different makers and models of player .
In contrast , LaserDisc playback quality is highly dependent on hardware quality .
In the 1990s , notable players sold for anywhere from US$ 200 to well over $ 1,000 , while older and less desirable players could be purchased in working condition for as little as $ 25 .

Many early LDs were not manufactured properly ; sometimes a substandard adhesive was used to sandwich together the two sides of the --OOV-- needed ] The adhesive contained impurities that were able to penetrate the lacquer seal layer and chemically attack the metalized reflective aluminium layer , causing it to oxidize and lose its reflective characteristics .
This was a problem that was termed " laser rot " among LD enthusiasts , also called " color flash " internally by LaserDisc - pressing plants .
Some forms of laser rot could appear as black spots that looked like mold or burned plastic which cause the disc to skip and the movie to exhibit excessive speckling noise .
LaserDisc did not have high market penetration in North America due to the high cost of the players and discs , which were far more expensive than VHS players and tapes , and due to marketplace confusion with the technologically inferior CED , which also went by the name Videodisc .
While the format was not widely adopted by North American consumers , it was well received among videophiles due to the superior audio and video quality compared to VHS and Betamax tapes , finding a place in nearly one million American homes by the end of 1990 .
The format was more popular in Japan than in North America because prices were kept low to ensure adoption , resulting in minimal price differences between VHS tapes and the higher quality LaserDiscs , helping ensure that it quickly became the dominant consumer video format in Japan .
LaserDiscs were also popular alternatives to videocassettes among movie enthusiasts in the more affluent regions of South East Asia , such as Singapore , due to their high integration with the Japanese export market and the disc - based media 's superior longevity compared to videocassette , especially in the humid conditions endemic to that area of the world .
The format also became quite popular in Hong Kong during the 1990s before the introduction of VCDs and DVD ; although people rarely bought the discs ( because each LD was priced around USD100 ) , high rental activity helped the video rental business in the city grow larger than it had ever been previously .
Due to integration with the Japanese export market , NTSC LaserDiscs were used in the Hong Kong market , in contrast to the PAL standard used for broadcast ( This anomaly also exists for DVD ) .

Only 24 --OOV-- systems were ever built , even though the ideas and technology are still in use today .
This eliminated the need for racks and racks of industrial LaserDisc players since --OOV-- discs were only single - sided .
In the mid-1980s Lucasfilm pioneered the --OOV-- non - linear editing system for film and television based on computer - controlled LaserDisc players .
In 1986 , a SCSI - equipped LaserDisc player attached to a BBC Master computer was used for the BBC Domesday Project .

The player was referred as an LV - ROM ( LaserVision Read Only Memory ) as the discs contained the driving software as well as the video frames .
The discs used the CAV format , and encoded data as a binary signal represented by the analog audio recording .
Apple 's HyperCard scripting language provided Macintosh computer users with a means to design databases of slides , animation , video and sounds from LaserDiscs and then to create interfaces for users to play specific content from the disc through software called --OOV-- .

User - created " stacks " were shared and were especially popular in education where teacher - generated stacks were used to access discs ranging from art collections to basic biological processes .
Commercially available stacks were also popular with the Voyager company being possibly the most successful distributor .
Under contract from the U.S. Military , Matrox produced a combination computer / LaserDisc player for instructional purposes .
Together they weighed 43 lb ( 20 kg ) and sturdy handles were provided in case two people were required to lift the unit .
Nevertheless , it is possible to control the unit by removing the ribbon cable and connecting a serial cable directly from the computer 's serial port to the port on the LaserDisc player .
The format 's instant - access capability made it possible for a new breed of LaserDisc - based video arcade games and several companies saw potential in using LaserDiscs for video games in the 1980s and 1990s , beginning in 1983 with Sega 's Astron Belt .

Encoded using NHK 's MUSE " Hi - Vision " analogue TV system , MUSE discs would operate like standard LaserDiscs but would contain high - definition --OOV-- ( 1,035 visible lines ) ( Sony --OOV-- ) video with a 5:3 aspect ratio .
The red laser was capable of reading through disc defects such as scratches and even mild disc rot that would cause most other players to stop , stutter or drop - out .
Crosstalk was not an issue with MUSE discs , and the narrow wavelength of the laser allowed for the virtual elimination of crosstalk with normal discs .
In 1991 , several manufacturers announced specifications for what would become known as MUSE LaserDisc , representing a span of almost 15 years until the feats of this HD analog optical disc system would finally be duplicated digitally by HD DVD and Blu - ray Disc .
Equipment prices were high , especially for early HDTVs which generally eclipsed US$ 10,000 , and even in Japan the market for MUSE was tiny .

Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , Lawrence of Arabia , A League of Their Own , Bugsy , Close Encounters of the Third Kind , Bram Stoker 's Dracula and Chaplin were among the theatrical releases available on MUSE LDs .
Squeeze LDs were enhanced --OOV-- widescreen LaserDiscs .
Squeeze LDs were enhanced --OOV-- widescreen LaserDiscs .
Since very few people owned 16:9 displays , the marketability of these special discs was very limited .
If the discs were played on a standard 4:3 television the image would be distorted .
The advantage was a 33 % greater vertical resolution compared to letterboxed widescreen LaserDisc .
Terminator 2 was released twice in Squeeze LD , the second release being THX certified and a notable improvement over the first .

Another form of recordable LaserDisc that is completely playback - compatible with the LaserDisc format ( unlike --OOV-- with its caddy enclosure ) is the RLV , or Recordable LaserVision disc .
It was developed and first marketed by the Optical Disc Corporation ( ODC , now ODC Nimbus ) in 1984 .
It was developed and first marketed by the Optical Disc Corporation ( ODC , now ODC Nimbus ) in 1984 . RLV discs , like --OOV-- , are also a WORM technology , and function exactly like a CD - R disc .
The only cosmetic difference between an RLV disc and a regular factory - pressed LaserDiscs is their reflective purple - violet ( or blue with some RLV discs ) color resulting from the dye embedded in the reflective layer of the disc to make it recordable , as opposed to the silver mirror appearance of regular LDs .

There were also 12 cm ( 4.7 in ) ( CD size ) " single --OOV-- style discs produced that were playable on LaserDisc players .
These were referred to as CD Video ( CD - V ) discs , and Video Single Discs ( VSD ) .
A CD - V carried up to five minutes of analog LaserDisc - type video content ( usually a music video ) , as well as up to 20 minutes of digital audio CD tracks .

The original 1989 release of David Bowie 's retrospective Sound + Vision CD box set prominently featured a CD - V video of Ashes to Ashes , and standalone promo CD - Vs featured the video , plus three audio tracks : " John , I 'm Only Dancing " , " Changes " , and " The Supermen " .
VSDs were the same as CD - Vs , but without the audio CD tracks .
VSDs were popular only in Japan and other parts of Asia , and were never fully introduced to the rest of the world .
VSDs were the same as CD - Vs , but without the audio CD tracks .
These terms originated from the common layouts of the shallow drawers called type cases used to hold the movable type for letterpress printing .
The terms upper case and lower case can be written as two consecutive words , connected with a hyphen ( upper - case and lower - case ) , or as a single word ( uppercase and lowercase ) .
Traditionally , the capital letters were stored in a separate case that was located above the case that held the small letters , and the name proved easy to remember since capital letters are taller .

The convention followed by many British publishers ( including scientific publishers , like Nature , magazines , like The Economist and New Scientist , and newspapers , like The Guardian and The Times ) and U.S. newspapers is to use sentence - style capitalisation in headlines , where capitalisation follows the same rules that apply for sentences .

Examples of global publishers whose English - language house styles prescribe sentence - case titles and headings include the International Organization for Standardization .

In orthography and typography , letter case ( or just case ) is the distinction between the letters that are in larger upper case ( also capital letters , capitals , caps , large letters , or more formally majuscule , see Terminology ) and smaller lower case ( also small letters , or more formally minuscule , see Terminology ) in the written representation of certain languages .

Capitalisation in English , in terms of the general orthographic rules independent of context ( e.g. title vs. heading vs. text ) , is universally standardized for formal writing .
) In English , capital letters are used as the first letter of a sentence , a proper noun , or a proper adjective .
In some traditional forms of poetry , capitalisation has conventionally been used as a marker to indicate the beginning of a line of verse independent of any grammatical feature .
The names of the days of the week and the names of the months are also capitalised , as are the first - person pronoun " I " and the interjection " O " ( although the latter is uncommon in modern usage , with " oh " being preferred ) .

Originally alphabets were written entirely in majuscule letters , spaced between well - defined upper and lower bounds .
When written quickly with a pen , these tended to turn into rounder and much simpler forms .
These in turn formed the foundations for the Carolingian minuscule script , developed by Alcuin for use in the court of Charlemagne , which quickly spread across Europe .

Letter case is often prescribed by the grammar of a language or by the conventions of a particular discipline .
In orthography , the uppercase is primarily reserved for special purposes , such as the first letter of a sentence or of a proper noun , which makes the lowercase the more common variant in text .

Engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in upper - case letters , which are easier to distinguish than lowercase , especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small .
Engineering design drawings are typically labelled entirely in upper - case letters , which are easier to distinguish than lowercase , especially when space restrictions require that the lettering be small .
Typographically , the basic difference between the majuscules and minuscules is not that the majuscules are big and minuscules small , but that the majuscules generally have the same height .
In Times New Roman , for instance , b , d , f , h , k , l , t --OOV-- are the letters with ascenders , and g , j , p , q , y are the ones with descenders .
The height of the minuscules varies , as some of them have parts higher or lower than the average , i.e. ascenders and descenders .
Further to this , with old - style numerals still used by some traditional or classical fonts — although most do have a set of alternative Lining --OOV-- 6 and 8 make up the ascender set , and 3 , 4 , 5 , 7 and 9 the descender set .
Most Western languages ( particularly those with writing systems based on the Latin , Cyrillic , Greek , Coptic , and Armenian alphabets ) use letter cases in their written form as an aid to clarity .
Many other writing systems make no distinction between majuscules and minuscules – a system called unicameral script or unicase .
The Georgian alphabet is special since it used to be bicameral , but today is mostly used in a unicameral way .
Scripts using two separate cases are also called bicameral scripts .
In Latin , papyri from Herculaneum dating before 79 AD ( when it was destroyed ) have been found that have been written in old Roman cursive , where the early forms of minuscule letters " d " , " h " and " r " , for example , can already be recognised .
According to --OOV-- Knut Kleve , " The theory , then , that the lower - case letters have been developed from the fifth century uncials and the ninth century Carolingian minuscules seems to be wrong .
European languages , except for Ancient Greek and Latin , did not make the case distinction before about --OOV-- needed ]
" Both majuscule and minuscule letters existed , but the difference between the two variants was initially stylistic rather than orthographic and the writing system was still basically unicameral : a given handwritten document could use either one style or the other but these were not mixed .

As regards publication titles it is , however , a common typographic practice among both British and U.S. publishers to capitalise significant words ( and in the United States , this is often applied to headings , too ) .
This family of typographic conventions is usually called title case .
For example , R. M. Ritter 's Oxford Manual of Style ( 2002 ) suggests capitalising " the first word and all nouns , pronouns , adjectives , verbs and adverbs , but generally not articles , conjunctions and short prepositions " .
The rules for which words to capitalise are not based on any grammatically inherent correct / incorrect distinction and are not universally standardized ; they are arbitrary and differ between style guides , although in most styles they tend to follow a few strong conventions , as follows :
As briefly discussed in Unicode Technical Note # 26 , " In terms of implementation issues , any attempt at a unification of Latin , Greek , and Cyrillic would wreak havoc [ and ] make casing operations an unholy mess , in effect making all casing operations context sensitive [ … ] " .
In other words , while the shapes of letters like A , B , E , H , K , M , O , P , T , X , Y and so on are shared between the Latin , Greek , and Cyrillic alphabets ( and small differences in their canonical forms may be considered to be of a merely typographical nature ) , it would still be problematic for a multilingual character set or a font to provide only a single codepoint for , say , uppercase letter B , as this would make it quite difficult for a wordprocessor to change that single uppercase letter to one of the three different choices for the lower - case letter , b ( Latin ) , β ( Greek ) , or в ( Cyrillic ) .

Without letter case , a " unified European alphabet " – such as --OOV-- … Z , with an appropriate subset for each language – is feasible ; but considering letter case , it becomes very clear that these alphabets are rather distinct sets of symbols .

Many local landmarks were restored , including the ancient Towers of the medieval city ( Serrano Towers and Quart Towers ) , and the San Miguel de los Reyes monastery , which now holds a conservation library .
Starting in the mid-1990s , Valencia , formerly an industrial centre , saw rapid development that expanded its cultural and touristic possibilities , and transformed it into a newly vibrant city .
Whole sections of the old city , for example the Carmen Quarter , have been extensively renovated .
The English held the city for 16 months and defeated several attempts to expel them .
After the victory of the Bourbons at the Battle of Almansa on 25 April 1707 , the English army evacuated Valencia and Philip V ordered the repeal of the privileges of Valencia as punishment for the kingdom 's support of Charles of Austria .

By the Nueva Planta decrees ( --OOV-- de Nueva Planta ) the ancient Charters of Valencia were abolished and the city was governed by the Castilian Charter .
Philip ordered the Cortes to meet with the Viceroy of Valencia , Cardinal Luis de --OOV-- , who opposed the change of capital because of the proximity of Orihuela , a religious , cultural and now political centre , to Murcia ( capital of another viceroyalty and his diocese ) .
The city remained in the hands of Christian troops until 1102 , when the Almoravids retook the city and restored the Muslim religion .
Although the self - styled ' Emperor of All Spain ' , Alfonso VI of León and Castile , drove them from the city , he was not strong enough to hold it .
The event was commemorated in a poem by Ibn --OOV-- in which he thanked Yusuf ibn Tashfin for the city 's liberation .
The declining power of the Almoravids coincided with the rise of a new dynasty in North Africa , the Almohads , who seized control of the peninsula from the year 1145 , although their entry into Valencia was deterred by Ibn --OOV-- , King of Valencia and Murcia until 1171 , at which time the city finally fell to the North Africans .

The 15th century was a time of Islamic economic expansion , known as the Valencian Golden Age , in which culture and the arts flourished .
Concurrent population growth made Valencia the most populous city in the Crown of Aragon .
At the end of the century the Silk Exchange ( Llotja de la Seda ) building was erected as the city became a commercial emporium that attracted merchants from all over Europe .
Local industry , led by textile production , reached a great development , and a financial institution , the --OOV-- de Taula , was created to support municipal banking operations ; Valencian bankers lent funds to Queen Isabella I of Castile for Columbus 's voyage in 1492 .

The silk industry had disappeared , but there was a large production of hides and skins , wood , metals and foodstuffs , this last with substantial exports , particularly of wine and citrus .
The best expression of this dynamic was in the regional exhibitions , including that of 1909 held next to the pedestrian avenue --OOV-- ( Paseo de la Alameda ) , which depicted the progress of agriculture and industry .

Despite challenging the town 's systems , Scout reveres Atticus as an authority above all others , because he believes that following one 's conscience is the highest priority , even when the result is social ostracism .
Jem says to their neighbor Miss Maudie the day after the trial , " It 's like bein ' a caterpillar wrapped in a cocoon ... I always thought Maycomb folks were the best folks in the world , least that 's what they seemed like " .
This leads him to struggle with understanding the separations of race and class .
Claudia Durst Johnson considers it " reasonable to believe " that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama : Rosa Parks ' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person , which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott , and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted ( Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled , but reinstated in 1980 ) .
In the years following its release , many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations .

" Both Austen and Lee challenged the social status quo and valued individual worth over social standing .
Scholars argue that Lee 's approach to class and race was more complex " than ascribing racial prejudice primarily to ' poor white trash ' ...

By balancing the masculine influences of Atticus and Jem with the feminine influences of Calpurnia and Miss Maudie , one scholar writes , " Lee gradually demonstrates that Scout is becoming a feminist in the South , for with the use of first - person narration , she indicates that --OOV-- Jean Louise still maintains the ambivalence about being a Southern lady she possessed as a child .

Bob Ewell , it is hinted , molested his daughter , and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house until Boo is remembered only as a phantom .
Apart from Atticus , the fathers described are abusers .

The opening quote by the 19th - century essayist Charles Lamb reads : " Lawyers , I suppose , were children once .
For example , she refuses to wear frilly clothes , saying that Aunt Alexandra 's " fanatical " attempts to place her in them made her feel " a pink cotton penitentiary closing in on [ her ] " .
Songbirds and their associated symbolism appear throughout the novel .

An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird , titled Go Set a Watchman , was controversially released on July 14 , 2015 .
The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor , despite dealing with the serious issues of rape and racial inequality .
The narrator 's father , Atticus Finch , has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers .
The strongest element of style noted by critics and reviewers is Lee 's talent for narration , which in an early review in Time was called " tactile brilliance " .
" Lee combines the narrator 's voice of a child observing her surroundings with a grown woman 's reflecting on her childhood , using the ambiguity of this voice combined with the narrative technique of flashback to play intricately with perspectives .
However , she gave some insight into her themes when , in a rare letter to the editor , she wrote in response to the passionate reaction her book caused : " Surely it is plain to the simplest intelligence that To Kill a Mockingbird spells out in words of seldom more than two syllables a code of honor and conduct , Christian in its ethic , that is the heritage of all Southerners .
The first part of the novel concerns the children 's fascination with Boo Radley and their feelings of safety and comfort in the neighborhood .
One writer was so impressed by Lee 's detailed explanations of the people of Maycomb that he categorized the book as Southern romantic regionalism .
This regionalist theme is further reflected in Mayella Ewell 's apparent powerlessness to admit her advances toward Tom Robinson , and Scout 's definition of " fine folks " being people with good sense who do the best they can with what they have .
The South itself , with its traditions and taboos , seems to drive the plot more than the characters .
Tom Robinson is the chief example among several innocents destroyed carelessly or deliberately throughout the novel .
However , scholar Christopher Metress connects the mockingbird to Boo Radley : " Instead of wanting to exploit Boo for her own fun ( as she does in the beginning of the novel by putting on gothic plays about his history ) , Scout comes to see him as a ' --OOV-- is , as someone with an inner goodness that must be cherished .
" The last pages of the book illustrate this as Scout relates the moral of a story Atticus has been reading to her , and in allusions to both Boo Radley and Tom Robinson states about a character who was misunderstood , " when they finally saw him , why he had n't done any of those things ... Atticus , he was real nice , " to which he responds , " Most people are , Scout , when you finally see them .
The novel exposes the loss of innocence so frequently that reviewer R. A. Dave claims that because every character has to face , or even suffer defeat , the book takes on elements of a classical tragedy .
The Chicago Sunday Tribune noted the even - handed approach to the narration of the novel 's events , writing : " This is in no way a sociological novel .
Some lamented the use of poor white Southerners , and one - dimensional black victims , and Granville Hicks labeled the book " melodramatic and contrived " .
When the book was first released , Southern writer Flannery O'Connor commented , " I think for a child 's book it does all right .
Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie writing in The Guardian states that Lee , rare among American novelists , writes with " a fiercely progressive ink , in which there is nothing inevitable about racism and its very foundation is open to question " , comparing her to William Faulkner , who wrote about racism as an inevitability .
Literary critic Rosemary Goring in Scotland 's The Herald notes the connections between Lee and Jane Austen , stating the book 's central theme , that " one ’s moral convictions are worth fighting for , even at the risk of being reviled " is eloquently discussed .
Native Alabamian Allen Barra sharply criticized Lee and the novel in The Wall Street Journal calling Atticus a " repository of cracker - barrel epigrams " and the novel represents a " sugar - coated myth " of Alabama history .
Although acknowledging that the novel works , Mallon blasts Lee 's " wildly unstable " narrative voice for developing a story about a content neighborhood until it begins to impart morals in the courtroom drama , following with his observation that " the book has begun to cherish its own goodness " by the time the case is --OOV-- 2 ] Defending the book , Akin Ajayi writes that justice " is often complicated , but must always be founded upon the notion of equality and fairness for all .
In its use of racial epithets , stereotyped depictions of superstitious blacks , and Calpurnia , who to some critics is an updated version of the " contented slave " motif and to others simply unexplored , the book is viewed as marginalizing black characters .
A Canadian language arts consultant found that the novel resonated well with white students , but that black students found it " demoralizing " .
Another criticism , articulated by Michael Lind , is that the novel indulges in classist stereotyping and demonization of poor rural " white trash " .
Diane McWhorter , Pulitzer Prize - winning historian of the Birmingham civil rights campaign , asserts that To Kill a Mockingbird condemns racism instead of racists , and states that every child in the South has moments of racial cognitive dissonance when they are faced with the harsh reality of inequality .
McWhorter writes of Lee , " for a white person from the South to write a book like this in the late 1950s is really unusual — by its very existence an act of --OOV-- 4 ] Author James McBride calls Lee brilliant but stops short of calling her brave : " I think by calling Harper Lee brave you kind of absolve yourself of your own racism ... She certainly set the standards in terms of how these issues need to be discussed , but in many ways I feel ... the moral bar 's been lowered .
According to a National Geographic article , the novel is so revered in Monroeville that people quote lines from it like Scripture ; yet Harper Lee herself refused to attend any performances , because " she abhors anything that trades on the book 's fame " .
Local residents call them " Mockingbird groupies " , and although Lee was not reclusive , she refused publicity and interviews with an emphatic " Hell , no !

Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality , including from hunting by humans , and is driven primarily by availability of food .
Many species of bird migrate .
Bird migration is the regular seasonal movement , often north and south along a flyway , between breeding and wintering grounds .

Shorter migrations are common , including altitudinal migrations on mountains such as the Andes and Himalayas .
The timing of migration seems to be controlled primarily by changes in day length .

Aristotle noted that cranes traveled from the steppes of Scythia to marshes at the headwaters of the Nile .
Aristotle however suggested that swallows and other birds hibernated .
This belief persisted as late as 1878 , when Elliott Coues listed the titles of no less than 182 papers dealing with the hibernation of swallows .

Even the " highly observant " Gilbert White , in his posthumously published 1789 The Natural History of Selborne , quoted a man 's story about swallows being found in a chalk cliff collapse " while he was a schoolboy at --OOV-- " , though the man denied being an eyewitness .
It was not until the end of the eighteenth century that migration as an explanation for the winter disappearance of birds from northern climes was accepted .
Thomas Bewick 's A History of British Birds ( Volume 1 , 1797 ) mentions a report from " a very intelligent master of a vessel " who , " between the islands of Minorca and Majorca , saw great numbers of Swallows flying northward " , and states the situation in Britain as follows :

Bird movements include those made in response to changes in food availability , habitat , or weather .
Non - migratory birds are said to be resident or sedentary .

Migration is the regular seasonal movement , often north and south , undertaken by many species of birds .
Many bird populations migrate long distances along a flyway .
The most common pattern involves flying north in the spring to breed in the temperate or Arctic summer and returning in the autumn to wintering grounds in warmer regions to the south .

As the days shorten in autumn , the birds return to warmer regions where the available food supply varies little with the season .
Also , the longer days of the northern summer provide extended time for breeding birds to feed their young . This helps diurnal birds to produce larger clutches than related non - migratory species that remain in the tropics .

A similar strategy is adopted by the greater --OOV-- bat , which preys on nocturnal passerine migrants .
The higher concentrations of migrating birds at stopover sites make them prone to parasites and pathogens , which require a heightened immune response .
Within a species not all populations may be migratory ; this is known as " partial migration " .
Partial migration is very common in the southern continents ; in Australia , 44 % of non - passerine birds and 32 % of passerine species are partially migratory .

Most migrations begin with the birds starting off in a broad front .
These routes typically follow mountain ranges or coastlines , sometimes rivers , and may take advantage of updrafts and other wind patterns or avoid geographical barriers such as large stretches of open water .

A common pattern in North America is clockwise migration , where birds flying North tend to be further West , and flying South tend to shift Eastwards .
Often , this front narrows into one or more preferred routes termed flyways .
Many , if not most , birds migrate in flocks .
Geese in a V - formation may conserve --OOV-- % of the energy they would need to fly alone .
Red knots Calidris canutus and dunlins Calidris alpina were found in radar studies to fly 5 km / h ( 3.1 mph ) faster in flocks than when they were flying alone .
For larger birds , flying in flocks reduces the energy cost .

An expedition to Mt. Everest found skeletons of northern pintail Anas acuta and black - tailed godwit Limosa limosa at 5,000 m ( 16,000 ft ) on the Khumbu Glacier .
Bar - headed geese Anser indicus have been recorded by GPS flying at up to 6,540 metres ( 21,460 ft ) while crossing the Himalayas , at the same time engaging in the highest rates of climb to altitude for any bird .
Seabirds fly low over water but gain altitude when crossing land , and the reverse pattern is seen in landbirds .
However most bird migration is in the range of 150 to 600 m ( 490 to 1,970 ft ) .
Bird strike aviation records from the United States show most collisions occur below 600 m ( 2,000 ft ) and almost none above 1,800 m ( 5,900 ft ) .
Most species of penguin ( Spheniscidae ) migrate by swimming .
These routes can cover over 1,000 km ( 620 mi ) .
Dusky grouse --OOV-- obscurus perform altitudinal migration mostly by walking .

Migratory routes and wintering grounds are traditional and learned by young during their first migration with their parents .
Rather , it could follow an hooked or arched line , with detours around geographical barriers .
For most land - birds , such barriers could consist in seas , large water bodies or high mountain ranges , because of the lack of stopover or feeding sites , or the lack of thermal columns for broad - winged birds .

The same considerations about barriers and detours that apply to long - distance land - bird migration apply to water birds , but in reverse : a large area of land without bodies of water that offer feeding sites may also be a barrier to a bird that feeds in coastal waters .
Detours avoiding such barriers are observed : for example , brent geese Branta bernicla migrating from the Taymyr Peninsula to the Wadden Sea travel via the White Sea coast and the Baltic Sea rather than directly across the Arctic Ocean and northern Scandinavia .

A similar situation occurs with waders ( called shorebirds in North America ) .
Many species , such as dunlin Calidris alpina and western sandpiper Calidris mauri , undertake long movements from their Arctic breeding grounds to warmer locations in the same hemisphere , but others such as semipalmated sandpiper C. pusilla travel longer distances to the tropics in the Southern Hemisphere .

Many --OOV-- birds breed in the southern hemisphere and migrate north in the southern winter .
The most pelagic species , mainly in the ' --OOV-- ' order Procellariiformes , are great wanderers , and the albatrosses of the southern oceans may circle the globe as they ride the " roaring forties " outside the breeding season .

Many are also among the longest - distance migrants ; sooty shearwaters Puffinus griseus nesting on the Falkland Islands migrate 14,000 km ( 8,700 mi ) between the breeding colony and the North Atlantic Ocean off Norway .
Some large broad - winged birds rely on thermal columns of rising hot air to enable them to soar .
These birds migrate in the daytime .
Batumi bottleneck in the Caucasus is one of the heaviest migratory funnels on earth .
Birds of prey such as honey buzzards which migrate using thermals lose only 10 to 20 % of their weight during migration , which may explain why they forage less during migration than do smaller birds of prey with more active flight such as falcons , hawks and harriers .
Avoiding flying over the Black Sea surface and across high mountains , hundreds of thousands of soaring birds funnel through an area around the city of Batumi , Georgia .
Many of the smaller insectivorous birds including the warblers , hummingbirds and flycatchers migrate large distances , usually at night .

The birds are referred to as passage migrants in the regions where they occur for short durations between the origin and destination .
They land in the morning and may feed for a few days before resuming their migration .
Nocturnal migrants minimize predation , avoid overheating , and can feed during the day .
One cost of nocturnal migration is the loss of sleep .
Migrants may be able to alter their quality of sleep to compensate for the loss .
Nocturnal migrants minimize predation , avoid overheating , and can feed during the day .
Many long - distance migrants appear to be genetically programmed to respond to changing day length .
Species that move short distances , however , may not need such a timing mechanism , instead moving in response to local weather conditions .
Thus mountain and moorland breeders , such as --OOV-- --OOV-- --OOV-- and white - throated dipper Cinclus Cinclus , may move only --OOV-- to escape the cold higher ground .
Other species such as merlin Falco columbarius and Eurasian skylark Alauda arvensis move further , to the coast or towards the south .
Species like the chaffinch are much less migratory in Britain than those of continental Europe , mostly not moving more than 5 km in their lives .
Short - distance passerine migrants have two evolutionary origins .
Those that have long - distance migrants in the same family , such as the common chiffchaff Phylloscopus --OOV-- , are species of southern hemisphere origins that have progressively shortened their return migration to stay in the northern hemisphere .

In the tropics there is little variation in the length of day throughout the year , and it is always warm enough for a food supply , but altitudinal migration occurs in some tropical birds .
There is evidence that this enables the migrants to obtain more of their preferred foods such as fruits .

Sometimes circumstances such as a good breeding season followed by a food source failure the following year lead to irruptions in which large numbers of a species move far beyond the normal range .
Bohemian waxwings Bombycilla garrulus well show this unpredictable variation in annual numbers , with five major arrivals in Britain during the nineteenth century , but 18 between the years 1937 and 2000 .

Red crossbills Loxia --OOV-- too are irruptive , with widespread invasions across England noted in 1251 , 1593 , 1757 , and 1791 .
Bird migration is primarily , but not entirely , a Northern Hemisphere phenomenon .
This is because land birds in high northern latitudes , where food becomes scarce in winter , leave for areas further south ( including the Southern Hemisphere ) to overwinter , and because the continental landmass is much larger in the Northern Hemisphere .
This is because land birds in high northern latitudes , where food becomes scarce in winter , leave for areas further south ( including the Southern Hemisphere ) to overwinter , and because the continental landmass is much larger in the Northern Hemisphere .
In contrast , among ( pelagic ) seabirds , species of the Southern Hemisphere are more likely to migrate .
This is because there is a large area of ocean in the Southern Hemisphere , and more islands suitable for seabirds to nest .
The control of migration , its timing and response are genetically controlled and appear to be a primitive trait that is present even in non - migratory species of birds .
The ability to navigate and orient themselves during migration is a much more complex phenomenon that may include both endogenous programs as well as learning .

Navigation is based on a variety of senses .
Many birds have been shown to use a sun compass .
Using the sun for direction involves the need for making compensation based on the time .
Navigation has also been shown to be based on a combination of other abilities including the ability to detect magnetic fields ( --OOV-- ) , use visual landmarks as well as olfactory cues .

Satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift .
The ability to successfully perform long - distance migrations can probably only be fully explained with an accounting for the cognitive ability of the birds to recognize habitats and form mental maps .
Satellite tracking of day migrating raptors such as ospreys and honey buzzards has shown that older individuals are better at making corrections for wind drift .
Migratory birds may use two electromagnetic tools to find their destinations : one that is entirely innate and another that relies on experience .
There is a neural connection between the eye and " Cluster N " , the part of the forebrain that is active during migrational orientation , suggesting that birds may actually be able to see the magnetic field of the earth .

At this stage the bird is in the position of a boy scout with a compass but no map , until it grows accustomed to the journey and can put its other capabilities to use .
Because birds migrate between northern and southern regions , the magnetic field strengths at different latitudes let it interpret the radical pair mechanism more accurately and let it know when it has reached its destination .
This can be due to flying past their destinations as in the " spring overshoot " in which birds returning to their breeding areas overshoot and end up further north than intended .

A related phenomenon called " --OOV-- " involves birds from one region joining similar birds from a different breeding region in the common winter grounds and then migrating back along with the new population .
This is especially common in some waterfowl , which shift from one flyway to another .

Birds need to alter their metabolism in order to meet the demands of migration .
The timing of this molt - usually once a year but sometimes twice - varies with some species molting prior to moving to their winter grounds and others molting prior to returning to their breeding grounds .
The storage of energy through the accumulation of fat and the control of sleep in nocturnal migrants require special physiological adaptations .
In addition , the feathers of a bird suffer from wear - and - tear and require to be molted .

Large scale climatic changes , as have been experienced in the past , are expected to have an effect on the timing of migration .
Studies have shown a variety of effects including timing changes in migration , breeding as well as population variations .

The migration of birds also aids the movement of other species , including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice , which in turn may carry micro - organisms including those of concern to human health .
Due to the global spread of avian influenza , bird migration has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission , but it has been found not to present a special risk ; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat .

The orientation behaviour of the bird inside the cage is studied quantitatively using the distribution of marks that the bird leaves on the walls of the cage .
Other approaches used in pigeon homing studies make use of the direction in which the bird vanishes on the horizon .
Hunting along migration routes threatens some bird species .
The populations of Siberian cranes ( --OOV-- --OOV-- ) that wintered in India declined due to hunting along the route , particularly in Afghanistan and Central Asia .
Birds were last seen in their favourite wintering grounds in Keoladeo National Park in 2002 .
Structures such as power lines , wind farms and offshore oil - rigs have also been known to affect migratory birds .
Other migration hazards include pollution , storms , wildfires , and habitat destruction along migration routes , denying migrants food at stopover points .

The extreme eastern section of the state contains the Outer Banks , a string of sandy , narrow barrier islands between the Atlantic Ocean and two inland waterways or " sounds " : Albemarle Sound in the north and Pamlico Sound in the south .
Small , isolated , and deeply eroded mountain ranges and peaks are located in the Piedmont , including the Sauratown Mountains , Pilot Mountain , the Uwharrie Mountains , Crowder 's Mountain , King 's Pinnacle , the Brushy Mountains , and the South Mountains .
The Piedmont region of central North Carolina is the state 's most urbanized and densely populated section .
The Piedmont ranges from about 300 to 400 feet ( 91 to 122 m ) in elevation in the east to over 1,000 feet ( 300 m ) in the west .
The coastal plain transitions to the Piedmont region along the Atlantic Seaboard fall line , a line which marks the elevation at which waterfalls first appear on streams and rivers .

Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk , especially in the eastern part of the state .
The western Piedmont is often protected by the mountains , which tend to break up storms as they try to cross over ; the storms will often re - form farther east .
Also a weather phenomenon known as " cold air damming " often occurs in the northwestern part of the state , which can also weaken storms but can also lead to major ice events in winter .

According to Microsoft developer Jensen Harris , these apps are to be optimized for touchscreen environments and are more specialized than current desktop applications . Apps can run either in a full - screen mode , or be snapped to the side of a screen .
Apps can use " contracts " ; a collection of hooks to provide common functionality that can integrate with other apps , including search and sharing .
Windows Store apps run within a new set of APIs known as Windows Runtime , which supports programming languages such as C , C++ , Visual Basic .NET , C # , along with HTML5 and JavaScript .
If written in some " high - level " languages , apps written for Windows Runtime can be compatible with both Intel and ARM versions of Windows , otherwise they are not binary code compatible .
Components may be compiled as Windows Runtime Components , permitting consumption by all compatible languages .
To ensure stability and security , apps run within a sandboxed environment , and require permissions to access certain functionality , such as accessing the Internet or a camera .
Retail versions of Windows 8 are only able to install these apps through Windows Store — a namesake distribution platform which offers both apps , and listings for desktop programs certified for comparability with Windows 8 .
A method to sideload apps from outside Windows Store is available to devices running Windows 8 Enterprise and joined to a domain ; Windows 8 Pro and Windows RT devices that are not part of a domain can also sideload apps , but only after special product keys are obtained through volume licensing .

Alongside the traditional Control Panel , a new simplified and touch - optimized settings app known as " PC Settings " is used for basic configuration and user settings .
It does not include many of the advanced options still accessible from the normal Control Panel .
The new user interface is based on Microsoft 's Metro design language , and uses a Start screen similar to that of Windows Phone 7 as the primary means of launching applications .
A vertical toolbar known as the charms ( accessed by swiping from the right edge of a touchscreen , or pointing the cursor at hotspots in the right corners of a screen ) provides access to system and app - related functions , such as search , sharing , device management , settings , and a Start button .

Support for playing DVD - Video was removed from Windows Media Player due to the cost of licensing the necessary decoders ( especially for devices which do not include optical disc drives at all ) and the prevalence of online streaming services .
For the same reasons , Windows Media Center is not included by default on Windows 8 , but Windows Media Center and DVD playback support can be purchased in the " Pro Pack " ( which upgrades the system to Windows 8 Pro ) or " Media Center Pack " add - on for Windows 8 Pro .
Several notable features have been removed in Windows 8 , beginning with the traditional Start menu .
Backup and Restore , the backup component of Windows , is deprecated .
It still ships with Windows 8 and continues to work on preset schedules , but is pushed to the background and can only be accessed through a Control Panel applet called " Windows 7 File --OOV-- Shadow Copy , a component of Windows Explorer that once saved previous versions of changed files , no longer protects local files and folders .
It can only access previous versions of shared files stored on a Windows Server --OOV-- The subsystem on which these components worked , however , is still available for other software to --OOV--

The amended requirement is intended to allow " greater design flexibility " for future products .
Microsoft released minimum hardware requirements for tablet and --OOV-- devices to be " certified " for Windows 8 , and defined a convertible form factor as a standalone device that combines the PC , display and rechargeable power source with a mechanically attached keyboard and pointing device in a single chassis .
A convertible can be transformed into a tablet where the attached input devices are hidden or removed leaving the display as the only input mechanism .
On March 12 , 2013 , Microsoft amended its certification requirements to only require that screens on tablets have a minimum resolution of --OOV-- ( down from the previous --OOV-- ) .
Windows 8 is available in three different editions , of which the lowest version , branded simply as Windows 8 , and Windows 8 Pro , were sold at retail in most countries , and as pre - loaded software on new computers .
For example , Pro added BitLocker , Hyper - V , the ability to join a domain , and the ability to install Windows Media Center as a paid add - on .
Windows 8 Enterprise contains additional features aimed towards business environments , and is only available through volume licensing .
A port of Windows 8 for ARM architecture , Windows RT , is marketed as an edition of Windows 8 , but was only included as pre - loaded software on devices specifically developed for it .

During these promotions , the Windows Media Center add - on for Windows 8 Pro was also offered for free .
Unlike previous versions of Windows , Windows 8 was distributed at retail in " Upgrade " licenses only , which require an existing version of Windows to install .
In lieu of full version , a specialized " System Builder " SKU was introduced .
The " System Builder " SKU replaced the original equipment manufacturer ( OEM ) SKU , which was only allowed to be used on PCs meant for resale , but added a " Personal Use License " exemption that officially allowed its purchase and personal use by users on homebuilt computers .

Retail distribution of Windows 8 has since been discontinued in favor of Windows 8.1 .
Unlike 8 , 8.1 is available as " full version software " at both retail and online for download that does not require a previous version of Windows in order to be installed .
With the retail release returning to full version software for Windows 8.1 , the " Personal Use License " exemption was removed from the OEM SKU , meaning that end users building their own PCs for personal use must use the full retail version in order to satisfy the Windows 8.1 licensing requirements .
Windows 8.1 with Bing is a special OEM - specific SKU of Windows 8.1 subsidized by Microsoft 's Bing search engine .
The three desktop editions of Windows 8 support 32-bit and 64-bit architectures ; retail copies of Windows 8 include install DVDs for both architectures , while the online installer automatically installs the version corresponding with the architecture of the system 's existing Windows installation .

Following the unveiling of Windows 8 , Microsoft faced criticism ( particularly from free software supporters ) for mandating that devices receiving its optional certification for Windows 8 have secure boot enabled by default using a key provided by Microsoft .
" Microsoft 's certification guidelines for Windows 8 ultimately revealed that vendors would be required to provide means for users to re - configure or disable secure boot in their device 's UEFI firmware .
In a post discussing secure boot on the Building Windows 8 blog , Microsoft developer Tony --OOV-- indicated that vendors would provide means to customize secure boot , stating that " At the end of the day , the customer is in control of their PC .
Microsoft 's philosophy is to provide customers with the best experience first , and allow them to make decisions themselves .
Several notable video game developers criticized Microsoft for making its Windows Store a closed platform subject to its own regulations , as it conflicted with their view of the PC as an open platform .
Markus " Notch " Persson ( creator of the indie game Minecraft ) , Gabe Newell ( co - founder of Valve Corporation and developer of software distribution platform Steam ) , and Rob Pardo from Activision Blizzard voiced concern about the closed nature of the Windows Store .

Markus " Notch " Persson ( creator of the indie game Minecraft ) , Gabe Newell ( co - founder of Valve Corporation and developer of software distribution platform Steam ) , and Rob Pardo from Activision Blizzard voiced concern about the closed nature of the Windows Store .
However , Tom Warren of The Verge stated that Microsoft 's addition of the Store was simply responding to the success of both Apple and Google in pursuing the " curated application store approach . "
David Pierce of The Verge described Windows 8 as " the first desktop operating system that understands what a computer is supposed to do in 2012 " and praised Microsoft 's " no compromise " approach and the operating system 's emphasis on Internet connectivity and cloud services .
Pierce also considered the Start Screen to be a " brilliant innovation for desktop computers " when compared with " folder - littered desktops on every other OS " because it allows users to interact with dynamic information .
Other improvements and features ( such as File History , Storage Spaces , and the updated Task Manager ) were also regarded as positive changes .
Bright also said that Windows 8 's duality towards tablets and traditional PCs was an " extremely ambitious " aspect of the platform as well , but criticized Microsoft for emulating Apple 's model of a closed distribution platform when implementing the Windows Store .
Bright wrote that its system of hot corners and edge swiping " was n't very obvious " due to the lack of instructions provided by the operating system on the functions accessed through the user interface , even by the video tutorial added on the RTM release ( which only instructed users to point at corners of the screen or swipe from its sides ) .
Others , such as Adrian Kingsley - Hughes from ZDNet , considered the interface to be " clumsy and impractical " due to its inconsistent design ( going as far as considering it " two operating systems unceremoniously bolted together " ) , and concluded that " Windows 8 was n't born out of a need or demand ; it was born out of a desire on Microsoft 's part to exert its will on the PC industry and decide to shape it in a direction — touch and tablets -- that allows it to compete against , and remain relevant in the face of Apple 's iPad .
The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction .
The market research firm IDC reported an overall drop in PC sales for the quarter , and said the drop may have been partly due to consumer reluctance to embrace the new features of the OS and poor support from OEM for these features .
This capped the first year of declining PC sales to the Asia Pacific region , as consumers bought more mobile devices than Windows PCs .
However , according to research firm NPD , sales of devices running Windows in the United States have declined 21 percent compared to the same time period in 2011 .
As the holiday shopping season wrapped up , Windows 8 sales continued to lag , even as Apple reported brisk sales .
Windows 8 's tablet market share has also been growing steadily , with 7.4 % of tablets running Windows in Q1 2013 according to Strategy Analytics , up from nothing just a year before .
However , this is still well below Android and iOS , which posted 43.4 % and 48.2 % market share respectively , although both operating systems have been on the market much longer than Windows 8 .

Strategy Analytics also noted " a shortage of top tier apps " for Windows tablets despite Microsoft strategy of paying developers to create apps for the operating system ( in addition to for Windows Phone ) .
Windows 8 surpassed Windows Vista in market share with a 5.1 % usage rate according to numbers posted in July 2013 by Net Applications , with usage on a steady upward trajectory .
In March 2013 , Microsoft also amended its certification requirements to allow tablets to use the --OOV-- resolution as a minimum ; this change is expected to allow the production of certified Windows 8 tablets in smaller form factors — a market which is currently dominated by Android - based tablets .

In June 2014 , state broadcaster China Central Television ( CCTV ) broadcast a news story further characterizing Windows 8 as a threat to national security .
" Microsoft denied the claims in a number of posts on the Chinese social network Sina Weibo , which stated that the company had never " assisted any government in an attack of another government or clients " or provided client data to the U.S. government , never " provided any government the authority to directly visit " or placed any backdoors in its products and services , and that it had never concealed government requests for client data .
The story featured an interview with Ni Guangnan , who stated that operating systems could aggregate " sensitive user information " that could be used to " understand the conditions and activities of our national economy and society " , and alleged that per documents leaked by Edward Snowden , the U.S. government had worked with Microsoft to retrieve encrypted information .
Yang Min , a computer scientist at Fudan University , also stated that " the security features of Windows 8 are basically to the benefit of Microsoft , allowing them control of the users ' data , and that poses a big challenge to the national strategy for information security .

Furthermore , the corresponding simplicity of the hydrogen molecule and the corresponding cation --OOV-- --OOV-- 2 allowed fuller understanding of the nature of the chemical bond , which followed shortly after the quantum mechanical treatment of the hydrogen atom had been developed in the mid-1920s .
One of the first quantum effects to be explicitly noticed ( but not understood at the time ) was a Maxwell observation involving hydrogen , half a century before full quantum mechanical theory arrived .
According to quantum theory , this behavior arises from the spacing of the ( quantized ) rotational energy levels , which are particularly wide - spaced in H2 because of its low mass .

Hydrogen is found in the neutral atomic state in the interstellar medium .
The large amount of neutral hydrogen found in the damped Lyman - alpha systems is thought to dominate the cosmological baryonic density of the Universe up to redshift --OOV-- .
However , hydrogen is the third most abundant element on the Earth 's surface , mostly in the form of chemical compounds such as hydrocarbons and water .
Hydrogen gas is produced by some bacteria and algae and is a natural component of flatus , as is methane , itself a hydrogen source of increasing importance .
A molecular form called protonated molecular hydrogen ( --OOV-- --OOV-- 3 ) is found in the interstellar medium , where it is generated by ionization of molecular hydrogen from cosmic rays .

Hydrogen can be prepared in several different ways , but economically the most important processes involve removal of hydrogen from hydrocarbons .
At high temperatures ( --OOV-- K , --OOV-- ° C or --OOV-- ° F ) , steam ( water vapor ) reacts with methane to yield carbon monoxide and H --OOV-- 2 .
This reaction is favored at low pressures but is nonetheless conducted at high pressures ( 2.0 --OOV-- MPa , 20 atm or 600 inHg ) .
The product mixture is known as " synthesis gas " because it is often used directly for the production of methanol and related compounds .
Hydrocarbons other than methane can be used to produce synthesis gas with varying product ratios .
Consequently , steam reforming typically employs an excess of H --OOV-- --OOV-- Additional hydrogen can be recovered from the steam by use of carbon monoxide through the water gas shift reaction , especially with an iron oxide catalyst .
In the Haber process for the production of ammonia , hydrogen is generated from natural gas .
Electrolysis of brine to yield chlorine also produces hydrogen as a co - product .
There are more than 200 thermochemical cycles which can be used for water splitting , around a dozen of these cycles such as the iron oxide cycle , --OOV-- ) oxide – --OOV-- ) oxide cycle , zinc zinc - oxide cycle , sulfur - iodine cycle , copper - chlorine cycle and hybrid sulfur cycle are under research and in testing phase to produce hydrogen and oxygen from water and heat without using electricity .

In its turn , under anaerobic conditions , the ferrous hydroxide ( --OOV-- ) --OOV-- 2 ) can be oxidized by the protons of water to form magnetite and molecular hydrogen .
This process is described by the --OOV-- reaction :
In the absence of atmospheric oxygen ( O --OOV-- 2 ) , in deep geological conditions prevailing far away from Earth atmosphere , hydrogen ( H --OOV-- 2 ) is produced during the process of serpentinization by the anaerobic oxidation by the water protons ( --OOV-- ) of the ferrous ( Fe2 + ) silicate present in the crystal lattice of the fayalite ( Fe --OOV-- --OOV-- --OOV-- 4 , the olivine iron - endmember ) .

From all the fault gases formed in power transformers , hydrogen is the most common and is generated under most fault conditions ; thus , formation of hydrogen is an early indication of serious problems in the transformer 's life cycle .
Large quantities of H --OOV-- 2 are needed in the petroleum and chemical industries .
The key consumers of H --OOV-- 2 in the petrochemical plant include --OOV-- , hydrodesulfurization , and hydrocracking .
Hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals .
Hydrogen is highly soluble in many rare earth and transition metals and is soluble in both nanocrystalline and amorphous metals .
Hydrogen solubility in metals is influenced by local distortions or impurities in the crystal lattice .
These properties may be useful when hydrogen is purified by passage through hot palladium disks , but the gas 's high solubility is a metallurgical problem , contributing to the embrittlement of many metals , complicating the design of pipelines and storage tanks .

These include low density , low viscosity , and the highest specific heat and thermal conductivity of all gases .
Hydrogen is not an energy resource , except in the hypothetical context of commercial nuclear fusion power plants using deuterium or tritium , a technology presently far from development .
The Sun 's energy comes from nuclear fusion of hydrogen , but this process is difficult to achieve controllably on Earth .
Elemental hydrogen from solar , biological , or electrical sources require more energy to make it than is obtained by burning it , so in these cases hydrogen functions as an energy carrier , like a battery .
Nevertheless , elemental hydrogen has been widely discussed in the context of energy , as a possible future carrier of energy on an economy - wide scale .
Hydrogen is employed to saturate broken ( " dangling " ) bonds of amorphous silicon and amorphous carbon that helps stabilizing material properties .
It is also a potential electron donor in various oxide materials , including ZnO , SnO2 , CdO , MgO , ZrO2 , HfO2 , La2O3 , Y2O3 , TiO2 , SrTiO3 , LaAlO3 , SiO2 , Al2O3 , --OOV-- , --OOV-- , and --OOV-- .
H2 is a product of some types of anaerobic metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms , usually via reactions catalyzed by --OOV-- or nickel - containing enzymes called hydrogenases .
Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water .
The natural cycle of hydrogen production and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle .
Water splitting , in which water is decomposed into its component protons , electrons , and oxygen , occurs in the light reactions in all photosynthetic organisms .

Hydrogen poses a number of hazards to human safety , from potential detonations and fires when mixed with air to being an asphyxiant in its pure , oxygen - free form .
Hydrogen dissolves in many metals , and , in addition to leaking out , may have adverse effects on them , such as hydrogen embrittlement , leading to cracks and explosions .
Many physical and chemical properties of hydrogen depend on the parahydrogen / --OOV-- ratio ( it often takes days or weeks at a given temperature to reach the equilibrium ratio , for which the data is usually given ) .

The Constitution of the United States of America provides that the United States Congress has the power " To coin money " .
Section 5112 prescribes the forms , in which the United States dollars should be issued .
These coins are both designated in Section 5112 as " legal tender " in payment of debts .
The Sacagawea dollar is one example of the copper alloy dollar .
The pure silver dollar is known as the American Silver Eagle .
In the 16th century , Count Hieronymus Schlick of Bohemia began minting coins known as --OOV-- ( from German thal , or nowadays usually Tal , " valley " , cognate with " dale " in English ) , named for --OOV-- , the valley where the silver was mined ( St. Joachim 's Valley , now Jáchymov ; then part of the Kingdom of Bohemia , now part of the Czech Republic ) .

Joachimstaler was later shortened to the German Taler , a word that eventually found its way into Danish and Swedish as daler , Norwegian as --OOV-- and daler , Dutch as daler or --OOV-- , Ethiopian as --OOV-- ( --OOV-- ) , Hungarian as --OOV-- , Italian as --OOV-- , and English as dollar .
Alternatively , thaler is said to come from the German coin --OOV-- ( " great guilder " , being of silver but equal in value to a gold guilder ) , minted from the silver from Joachimsthal .
The early currency of the United States did not exhibit faces of presidents , as is the custom now ; although today , by law , only the portrait of a deceased individual may appear on United States currency .
In fact , the newly formed government was against having portraits of leaders on the currency , a practice compared to the policies of European monarchs .
The currency as we know it today did not get the faces they currently have until after the early 20th century ; before that " heads " side of coinage used profile faces and striding , seated , and standing figures from Greek and Roman mythology and composite Native Americans .

The last coins to be converted to profiles of historic Americans were the dime ( 1946 ) and the Dollar ( 1971 ) .
The use of paper money not backed by precious metals had also occurred under the Articles of Confederation from 1777 to 1788 .
In 1862 , paper money was issued without the backing of precious metals , due to the Civil War .
This disconnection from gold and silver backing also occurred during the War of 1812 .
With no solid backing and being easily counterfeited , the continentals quickly lost their value , giving rise to the phrase " not worth a continental " .
This was a primary reason for the " No state shall ... make any thing but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts " clause in article 1 , section 10 of the United States Constitution .
In February 2007 , the U.S. Mint , under the Presidential $ 1 Coin Act of 2005 , introduced a new $ 1 U.S. Presidential dollar coin .
The reverse side features the Statue of Liberty .
To allow for larger , more detailed portraits , the traditional inscriptions of " E Pluribus Unum " , " In God We Trust " , the year of minting or issuance , and the mint mark will be inscribed on the edge of the coin instead of the face .
The inscription " Liberty " has been eliminated , with the Statue of Liberty serving as a sufficient replacement .
Another unusual fact about the new $ 1 coin is Grover Cleveland will have two coins with his portrait issued due to the fact he was the only U.S. President to be elected to two non - consecutive terms .
When the Federal Reserve makes a purchase , it credits the seller 's reserve account ( with the Federal Reserve ) .
To fulfill those requests , the Federal Reserve places an order for printed money from the U.S. Treasury Department .
The Treasury Department in turn sends these requests to the Bureau of Engraving and Printing ( to print new dollar bills ) and the Bureau of the Mint ( to stamp the coins ) .

Commercial banks can freely withdraw in cash any excess reserves from their reserve account at the Federal Reserve .
The value of the U.S. dollar declined significantly during wartime , especially during the American Civil War , World War I , and World War II .
The Federal Reserve , which was established in 1913 , was designed to furnish an " elastic " currency subject to " substantial changes of quantity over short periods " , which differed significantly from previous forms of high - powered money such as gold , national bank notes , and silver coins .

Over the very long run , the prior gold standard kept prices stable — for instance , the price level and the value of the U.S. dollar in 1914 was not very different from the price level in the 1880s .
The Federal Reserve initially succeeded in maintaining the value of the U.S. dollar and price stability , reversing the inflation caused by the First World War and stabilizing the value of the dollar during the 1920s , before presiding over a 30 % deflation in U.S. prices in the 1930s .
There is ongoing debate about whether central banks should target zero inflation ( which would mean a constant value for the U.S. dollar over time ) or low , stable inflation ( which would mean a continuously but slowly declining value of the dollar over time , as is the case now ) .

A " grand " , sometimes shortened to simply " G " , is a common term for the amount of $ 1,000 .
A " large " or " stack " , it is usually a reference to a multiple of $ 1,000 ( such as " fifty large " meaning $ 50,000 ) .
The $ 100 note is nicknamed " Benjamin " , " Benji " , " Ben " , or " Franklin " ( after Benjamin Franklin ) , " C - note " ( C being the Roman numeral for 100 ) , " Century note " or " bill " ( e.g. " two bills " being $ 200 ) .
The $ 50 note is occasionally called a " yardstick " or a " grant " ( after President Ulysses S. Grant , pictured on the obverse ) .
The newer designs , with portraits displayed in the main body of the obverse rather than in cameo insets upon paper color - coded by denomination , are sometimes referred to as " --OOV-- " notes or " Monopoly money " .
The U.S. dollar was created by the Constitution and defined by the Coinage Act of 1792 .
It specified a " dollar " to be based in the Spanish milled dollar and of 371 grains and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of pure or 416 grains ( 27.0 g ) of standard silver and an " eagle " to be 247 and 4 eighths of a grain or 270 grains ( 17 g ) of gold ( again depending on purity ) .
It specified a " dollar " to be based in the Spanish milled dollar and of 371 grains and 4 sixteenths part of a grain of pure or 416 grains ( 27.0 g ) of standard silver and an " eagle " to be 247 and 4 eighths of a grain or 270 grains ( 17 g ) of gold ( again depending on purity ) .
The choice of the value 371 grains arose from Alexander Hamilton 's decision to base the new American unit on the average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars .
A new Spanish dollar was usually about 377 grains in weight , and so the new U.S. dollar was at a slight discount in relation to the Spanish dollar .
The United States Mint produces Proof Sets specifically for collectors and speculators .
Silver Proofs tend to be the standard designs but with the dime , quarter , and half dollar containing 90 % silver .
Starting in 1983 and ending in 1997 , the Mint also produced proof sets containing the year 's commemorative coins alongside the regular coins .
Another type of proof set is the Presidential Dollar Proof Set where four special $ 1 coins are minted each year featuring a president .
Because of budget constraints and increasing stockpiles of these relatively unpopular coins , the production of new Presidential dollar coins for circulation was suspended on December 13 , 2011 , by U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner .
The Constitution provides that " a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time " .
That provision of the Constitution is made specific by Section 331 of Title 31 of the United States Code .
The sums of money reported in the " Statements " are currently being expressed in U.S. dollars ( for example , see the 2009 Financial Report of the United States Government ) .
The U.S. dollar may therefore be described as the unit of account of the United States .
Currently printed denominations are $ 1 , $ 2 , $ 5 , $ 10 , $ 20 , $ 50 , and $ 100 .
Notes above the $ 100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969 .
Notes above the $ 100 denomination stopped being printed in 1946 and were officially withdrawn from circulation in 1969 .
These notes were used primarily in inter - bank transactions or by organized crime ; it was the latter usage that prompted President Richard Nixon to issue an executive order in 1969 halting their use .

" Greenback " is another nickname originally applied specifically to the 19th century Demand Note dollars created by Abraham Lincoln to finance the costs of the Civil War for the North .
The original note was printed in black and green on the back side .
The value of the U.S. dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold , and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the value of the U.S. currency .
The value of the U.S. dollar was therefore no longer anchored to gold , and it fell upon the Federal Reserve to maintain the value of the U.S. currency .
The Federal Reserve , however , continued to increase the money supply , resulting in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the U.S. dollar in the 1970s .
This was largely due to the prevailing economic view at the time that inflation and real economic growth were linked ( the Phillips curve ) , and so inflation was regarded as relatively benign .
Between 1965 and 1981 , the U.S. dollar lost two thirds of its value .
The dollar was first based on the value and look of the Spanish dollar , used widely in Spanish America from the 16th to the 19th centuries .

The Spanish , U.S. silver dollars , and later , Mexican silver pesos circulated side by side in the United States , and the Spanish dollar and Mexican peso remained legal tender until the Coinage Act of 1857 .
The Gold Standard Act of 1900 abandoned the bimetallic standard and defined the dollar as 23.22 grains ( 1.505 g ) of gold , equivalent to setting the price of 1 troy ounce of gold at $ 20.67 .

Silver coins continued to be issued for circulation until 1964 , when all silver was removed from dimes and quarters , and the half dollar was reduced to 40 % silver .
Gold coins were confiscated by Executive Order 6102 issued in 1933 by Franklin Roosevelt .
Early releases of the Washington coin included error coins shipped primarily from the Philadelphia mint to Florida and Tennessee banks .

Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years , whereas coins are more permanent .
Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to " heads " , some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying " upside down lettering error " coins .
As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes , they commonly accept only $ 1 bills , though a few will give change in dollar coins .
The U.S. Constitution provides that Congress shall have the power to " borrow money on the credit of the United States " .
Congress has exercised that power by authorizing Federal Reserve Banks to issue Federal Reserve Notes .
Those notes are " obligations of the United States " and " shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States , in the city of Washington , District of Columbia , or at any Federal Reserve bank " .
Those notes are " obligations of the United States " and " shall be redeemed in lawful money on demand at the Treasury Department of the United States , in the city of Washington , District of Columbia , or at any Federal Reserve bank " .
The Federal Reserve Note is the only type that remains in circulation since the 1970s .
Usually , the short - term goal of open market operations is to achieve a specific short - term interest rate target .
For example , in the case of the United States the Federal Reserve targets the federal funds rate , the rate at which member banks lend to one another overnight .

Rising government spending in the 1960s , however , led to doubts about the ability of the United States to maintain this convertibility , gold stocks dwindled as banks and international investors began to convert dollars to gold , and as a result the value of the dollar began to decline .
Facing an emerging currency crisis and the imminent danger that the United States would no longer be able to redeem dollars for gold , gold convertibility was finally terminated in 1971 by President Nixon , resulting in the " Nixon shock " .
The U.S. dollar is fiat money .
Several countries use it as their official currency , and in many others it is the de facto currency .

This has to do with Alexander Hamilton 's suggestion to Congress of a fixed 15:1 ratio of silver to gold , respectively .
The gold coins that were minted however , were not given any denomination whatsoever and traded for a market value relative to the Congressional standard of the silver dollar .

The Susan B. Anthony dollar coin was introduced in 1979 ; these proved to be unpopular because they were often mistaken for quarters , due to their nearly equal size , their milled edge , and their similar color .
In 2000 , a new $ 1 coin , featuring Sacagawea , ( the Sacagawea dollar ) was introduced , which corrected some of the problems of the Anthony dollar by having a smooth edge and a gold color , without requiring changes to vending machines that accept the Anthony dollar .
Gold dollars were also minted in the 19th century .

Toward the end of the 2nd century , Christians began condemning the instruments themselves .
Those who oppose instruments today believe these Church Fathers had a better understanding of God 's desire for the --OOV-- needed ] but there are significant differences between the teachings of these Church Fathers and Christian opposition to instruments today .
The use of musical instruments is traditionally forbidden on the Sabbath out of concern that players would be tempted to repair ( or tune ) their instruments , which is forbidden on those days .
) Similarly , when Jewish families and larger groups sing traditional Sabbath songs known as --OOV-- outside the context of formal religious services , they usually do so a cappella , and Bar and Bat Mitzvah celebrations on the Sabbath sometimes feature entertainment by a cappella ensembles .
This has led to a tradition of a cappella singing sometimes known as sefirah music .

A strong and prominent a cappella tradition was begun in the midwest part of the United States in 1911 by F. Melius Christiansen , a music faculty member at St. Olaf College in Northfield , Minnesota .
The St. Olaf College Choir was established as an outgrowth of the local St. John 's Lutheran Church , where Christiansen was organist and the choir was composed , at least partially , of students from the nearby St. Olaf campus .
The success of the ensemble was emulated by other regional conductors , and a rich tradition of a cappella choral music was born in the region at colleges like Concordia College ( Moorhead , Minnesota ) , Augustana College ( Rock Island , Illinois ) , Wartburg College ( Waverly , Iowa ) , Luther College ( Decorah , Iowa ) , Gustavus Adolphus College ( St. Peter , Minnesota ) , Augustana College ( Sioux Falls , South Dakota ) , and Augsburg College ( Minneapolis , Minnesota ) .
The choirs typically range from 40 to 80 singers and are recognized for their efforts to perfect blend , intonation , phrasing and pitch in a large choral setting .

In addition to singing words , some a cappella singers also emulate instrumentation by reproducing instrumental sounds with their vocal cords and mouth .
One of the earliest 20th century practitioners of this method were The Mills Brothers whose early recordings of the 1930s clearly stated on the label that all instrumentation was done vocally .
In the 1960s , the Swingle Singers used their voices to emulate musical instruments to Baroque and Classical music .
Another famous example of emulating instrumentation instead of singing the words is the theme song for The New Addams Family series on Fox Family Channel ( now ABC Family ) .
The Swingle Singers used nonsense words to sound like instruments , but have been known to produce non - verbal versions of musical instruments .
Beatboxing , more accurately known as vocal percussion , is a technique used in a cappella music popularized by the hip - hop community , where rap is often performed a cappella also .

He published 150 papers in his life ; 60 in pure mathematics , 20 in physics , and 60 in applied mathematics .
His last work , an unfinished manuscript written while in the hospital , was later published in book form as The Computer and the Brain .
He was a pioneer of the application of operator theory to quantum mechanics , in the development of functional analysis , a principal member of the Manhattan Project and the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton ( as one of the few originally appointed ) , and a key figure in the development of game theory and the concepts of cellular automata , the universal constructor and the digital computer .
He published 150 papers in his life ; 60 in pure mathematics , 20 in physics , and 60 in applied mathematics .
Von Neumann 's mathematical analysis of the structure of self - replication preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA .

During World War II he worked on the Manhattan Project with J. Robert Oppenheimer and Edward Teller , developing the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the implosion - type nuclear weapon .
After the war , he served on the General Advisory Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission , and later as one of its commissioners .
He was a consultant to a number of organizations , including the United States Air Force , the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project , and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
Along with theoretical physicist Edward Teller , mathematician Stanislaw Ulam , and others , he worked out key steps in the nuclear physics involved in thermonuclear reactions and the hydrogen bomb .
Von Neumann was born Neumann János Lajos ( in Hungarian the family name comes first ) , Hebrew name Yonah , in Budapest , Kingdom of Hungary , which was then part of the Austro - Hungarian Empire , to wealthy Jewish parents of the Haskalah .
He had two younger brothers : Michael , born in 1907 , and Nicholas , who was born in 1911 .
His father , Neumann Miksa ( Max Neumann ) was a banker , who held a doctorate in law .
He had moved to Budapest from Pécs at the end of the 1880s .
John 's mother was Kann Margit ( Margaret Kann ) ; her parents were Jakab Kann and Katalin Meisels .
In 1913 , his father was elevated to the nobility for his service to the Austro - Hungarian Empire by Emperor Franz Joseph .
In 1913 , his father was elevated to the nobility for his service to the Austro - Hungarian Empire by Emperor Franz Joseph .
The Neumann family thus acquired the hereditary appellation --OOV-- , meaning of --OOV-- .
Neumann János became --OOV-- Neumann János ( John Neumann of --OOV-- ) , which he later changed to the German Johann von Neumann .
Formal schooling did not start in Hungary until the age of ten .
Instead , governesses taught von Neumann , his brothers and his cousins .
Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential , so the children were tutored in English , French , German and Italian .
By the age of 8 , von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus , but he was particularly interested in history , reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken 's Allgemeine Geschichte in --OOV-- .
Von Neumann entered the Lutheran --OOV-- --OOV-- --OOV-- in 1911 .
Under the Hungarian system , children received all their education at the one gymnasium .
Collectively , they were sometimes known as Martians .
When asked why the Hungary of his generation had produced so many geniuses , Wigner , who won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1963 , replied that von Neumann was the only genius .
At the age of 15 , he began to study advanced calculus under the renowned analyst Gábor --OOV-- .

By the age of 19 , von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers , the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers , which superseded Georg Cantor 's definition .
By the age of 19 , von Neumann had published two major mathematical papers , the second of which gave the modern definition of ordinal numbers , which superseded Georg Cantor 's definition .
At the conclusion of his education at the gymnasium , von Neumann sat for and won the Eötvös Prize , a national prize for mathematics .
So it was decided that the best career path was to become a chemical engineer .
This was not something that von Neumann had much knowledge of , so it was arranged for him to take a two - year non - degree course in chemistry at the University of Berlin , after which he sat the entrance exam to the prestigious ETH Zurich , which he passed in September 1923 .
At the same time , von Neumann also entered Pázmány Péter University in Budapest , as a Ph.D. candidate in mathematics .
For his thesis , he chose to produce an axiomatization of Cantor 's set theory .
Von Neumann 's habilitation was completed on December 13 , 1927 , and he started his lectures as a --OOV-- at the University of Berlin in 1928 .
By the end of 1927 , von Neumann had published twelve major papers in mathematics , and by the end of 1929 , thirty - two papers , at a rate of nearly one major paper per month .

Before his marriage he was baptized a Catholic . Max had died in 1929 .
They had one child , a daughter , Marina , who is now a distinguished professor of business administration and public policy at the University of Michigan .
In October 1938 , von Neumann married Klara Dan , whom he had met during his last trips back to Budapest prior to the outbreak of World War II .
In 1933 , von Neumann was offered a lifetime professorship on the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study when the institute 's plan to appoint Hermann Weyl fell through .
His mother , brothers and in - laws followed John to the United States in 1939 .
Von Neumann became a naturalized citizen of the United States in 1937 , and immediately tried to become a lieutenant in the United States Army 's Officers Reserve Corps .
He passed the exams easily , but was ultimately rejected because of his age .
He enjoyed Yiddish and " off - color " humor ( especially limericks ) .
At Princeton he received complaints for regularly playing extremely loud German march music on his gramophone , which distracted those in neighbouring offices , including Albert Einstein , from their work .

Von Neumann 's closest friend in the United States was mathematician Stanislaw Ulam .
A later friend of Ulam 's , Gian - Carlo Rota writes : " They would spend hours on end gossiping and giggling , swapping Jewish jokes , and drifting in and out of mathematical talk .
" When von Neumann was dying in hospital , every time Ulam would visit he would come prepared with a new collection of jokes to cheer up his friend .
At the beginning of the 20th century , efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell 's paradox ( on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves ) .
The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel .
In his doctoral thesis of 1925 , von Neumann demonstrated two techniques to exclude such sets — the axiom of foundation and the notion of class .
To demonstrate that the addition of this new axiom to the others did not produce contradictions , von Neumann introduced a method of demonstration , called the method of inner models , which later became an essential instrument in set theory .
The axiom of foundation established that every set can be constructed from the bottom up in an ordered succession of steps by way of the principles of Zermelo and Fraenkel , in such a manner that if one set belongs to another then the first must necessarily come before the second in the succession , hence excluding the possibility of a set belonging to itself .

The second approach to the problem took as its base the notion of class , and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes , while a proper class is defined as a class which does not belong to other classes .
Under the Zermelo – Fraenkel approach , the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves .
In contrast , under the von Neumann approach , the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed , but it is a proper class and not a set .
A strongly negative answer arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg , in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness : the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete , in the sense that they can not prove every truth which is expressible in their language .

But von Neumann , who had participated at the Congress , confirmed his fame as an instantaneous thinker , and in less than a month was able to communicate to Gödel himself an interesting consequence of his theorem : namely that the usual axiomatic systems are unable to demonstrate their own consistency .

However , Gödel had already discovered this consequence , now known as his second incompleteness theorem and sent von Neumann a preprint of his article containing both incompleteness theorems .
Von Neumann founded the field of continuous geometry . It followed his path - breaking work on rings of operators .
In mathematics , continuous geometry is an analogue of complex projective geometry , where instead of the dimension of a subspace being in a discrete set 0 , 1 , ... , n , it can be an element of the unit interval [ 0,1 ] .
Von Neumann was motivated by his discovery of von Neumann algebras with a dimension function taking a continuous range of dimensions , and the first example of a continuous geometry other than projective space was the projections of the --OOV-- type II factor .
In a series of famous papers , von Neumann made spectacular contributions to measure theory .
Von Neumann 's work argued that the " problem is essentially group - theoretic in character , and that , in particular , for the solvability of the problem of measure the ordinary algebraic concept of solvability of a group is relevant .
Thus , according to von Neumann , it is the change of group that makes a difference , not the change of space .
In a number of von Neumann 's papers , the methods of argument he employed are considered even more significant than the results .
In 1938 , he was awarded the --OOV-- Memorial Prize for his work in analysis .
In his 1936 paper on analytic measure theory , he used the Haar theorem in the solution of Hilbert 's fifth problem in the case of compact groups .
A von Neumann algebra is a * --OOV-- of bounded operators on a Hilbert space that is closed in the weak operator topology and contains the identity operator .
The von Neumann --OOV-- theorem shows that the analytic definition is equivalent to a purely algebraic definition as an algebra of symmetries . The direct integral was introduced in 1949 by John von Neumann .
The direct integral was introduced in 1949 by John von Neumann .
Von Neumann introduced the study of rings of operators , through the von Neumann algebras .
Von Neumann worked on lattice theory between 1937 and 1939 .
It is conserved by perspective mappings ( " --OOV-- " ) and ordered by inclusion .
" Garrett Birkhoff writes : " John von Neumann 's brilliant mind blazed over lattice theory like a meteor " .
Any complemented modular lattice L having a " basis " of --OOV-- pairwise perspective elements , is isomorphic with the lattice --OOV-- ) of all principal right - ideals of a suitable regular ring R. This conclusion is the culmination of 140 pages of brilliant and incisive algebra involving entirely novel axioms .

Anyone wishing to get an unforgettable impression of the razor edge of von Neumann 's mind , need merely try to pursue this chain of exact reasoning for himself — realizing that often five pages of it were written down before breakfast , seated at a living room writing - table in a bathrobe .
Von Neumann was the first to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics , known as the Dirac – von Neumann axioms , with his 1932 work Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics .
Von Neumann was the first to establish a rigorous mathematical framework for quantum mechanics , known as the Dirac – von Neumann axioms , with his 1932 work Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics .
After having completed the axiomatization of set theory , he began to confront the axiomatization of quantum mechanics .
The physics of quantum mechanics was thereby reduced to the mathematics of Hilbert spaces and linear operators acting on them .
For example , the uncertainty principle , according to which the determination of the position of a particle prevents the determination of its momentum and vice versa , is translated into the non - commutativity of the two corresponding operators .
This new mathematical formulation included as special cases the formulations of both Heisenberg and Schrödinger .
Von Neumann 's abstract treatment permitted him also to confront the foundational issue of determinism versus non - determinism , and in the book he presented a proof that the statistical results of quantum mechanics could not possibly be averages of an underlying set of determined " hidden variables , " as in classical statistical mechanics .
In 1966 , John S. Bell published a paper arguing that the proof contained a conceptual error and was therefore invalid .
However , in 2010 , Jeffrey Bub argued that Bell had misconstrued von Neumann 's proof , and pointed out that the proof , though not valid for all hidden variable theories , does rule out a well - defined and important subset .
Bub also suggests that von Neumann was aware of this limitation , and that von Neumann did not claim that his proof completely ruled out hidden variable theories .
He concluded that the entire physical universe could be made subject to the universal wave function .
Since something " outside the calculation " was needed to collapse the wave function , von Neumann concluded that the collapse was caused by the consciousness of the experimenter ( although this view was accepted by Eugene Wigner , the Von Neumann – Wigner interpretation never gained acceptance amongst the majority of physicists ) .

In a famous paper of 1936 with Garrett Birkhoff , the first work ever to introduce quantum logics , von Neumann and Birkhoff first proved that quantum mechanics requires a propositional calculus substantially different from all classical logics and rigorously isolated a new algebraic structure for quantum logics .
The concept of creating a propositional calculus for quantum logic was first outlined in a short section in von Neumann 's 1932 work , but in 1936 , the need for the new propositional calculus was demonstrated through several proofs .
It was also demonstrated that the laws of distribution of classical logic , --OOV-- and , are not valid for quantum theory .
Von Neumann proved his minimax theorem in 1928 .
Von Neumann founded the field of game theory as a mathematical discipline . Von Neumann proved his minimax theorem in 1928 .
This theorem establishes that in zero - sum games with perfect information ( i.e. in which players know at each time all moves that have taken place so far ) , there exists a pair of strategies for both players that allows each to minimize his maximum losses , hence the name minimax .
When examining every possible strategy , a player must consider all the possible responses of his adversary . The player then plays out the strategy that will result in the minimization of his maximum loss .
The reason for this is that a quantum disjunction , unlike the case for classical disjunction , can be true even when both of the disjuncts are false and this is , in turn , attributable to the fact that it is frequently the case , in quantum mechanics , that a pair of alternatives are semantically determinate , while each of its members are necessarily indeterminate .

This latter property can be illustrated by a simple example .
Such strategies , which minimize the maximum loss for each player , are called optimal .
Von Neumann improved and extended the minimax theorem to include games involving imperfect information and games with more than two players , publishing this result in his 1944 Theory of Games and Economic Behavior ( written with Oskar Morgenstern ) .

Von Neumann raised the intellectual and mathematical level of economics in several stunning publications .
For his model of an expanding economy , von Neumann proved the existence and uniqueness of an equilibrium using his generalization of the Brouwer fixed - point theorem .
Von Neumann 's model of an expanding economy considered the matrix pencil --OOV-- A − --OOV-- with nonnegative matrices A and B ; von Neumann sought probability vectors p and q and a positive number λ that would solve the complementarity equation
In this model , the ( transposed ) probability vector p represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the " intensity " at which the production process would run .
In this model , the ( transposed ) probability vector p represents the prices of the goods while the probability vector q represents the " intensity " at which the production process would run .
The unique solution λ represents the growth factor which is 1 plus the rate of growth of the economy ; the rate of growth equals the interest rate .
Proving the existence of a positive growth rate and proving that the growth rate equals the interest rate were remarkable achievements , even for von Neumann .
Von Neumann 's results have been viewed as a special case of linear programming , where von Neumann 's model uses only nonnegative matrices .
In the proceedings of a conference on von Neumann 's growth model , Paul Samuelson said that many mathematicians had developed methods useful to economists , but that von Neumann was unique in having made significant contributions to economic theory itself .
This paper has been called the greatest paper in mathematical economics by several authors , who recognized its introduction of fixed - point theorems , linear inequalities , complementary slackness , and --OOV-- duality .
His interest in economics that led to that paper began as follows : When lecturing at Berlin in 1928 and 1929 he spent his summers back home in Budapest , and so did the economist Nicholas Kaldor , and they hit it off .

Kaldor recommended that von Neumann read a book by the mathematical economist Léon Walras .
Later , von Neumann suggested a new method of linear programming , using the homogeneous linear system of Gordan ( 1873 ) , which was later popularized by Karmarkar 's algorithm .
Von Neumann 's method used a pivoting algorithm between simplices , with the pivoting decision determined by a nonnegative least squares subproblem with a convexity constraint ( projecting the zero - vector onto the convex hull of the active simplex ) .
Von Neumann 's algorithm was the first interior point method of linear programming .
In 1941 , he derived the exact distribution of the ratio of the mean square of successive differences to the sample variance for independent and identically normally distributed variables .
This ratio was applied to the residuals from regression models and is commonly known as the Durbin – Watson statistic for testing the null hypothesis that the errors are serially independent against the alternative that they follow a stationary first order autoregression .

Von Neumann made fundamental contributions in exploration of problems in numerical hydrodynamics .
The mathematics of artificial viscosity smoothed the shock transition without sacrificing basic physics .
A problem was that when computers solved hydrodynamic or aerodynamic problems , they tried to put too many computational grid points at regions of sharp discontinuity ( shock waves ) .
Von Neumann 's principal contribution to the atomic bomb was in the concept and design of the explosive lenses needed to compress the plutonium core of the Fat Man weapon that was later dropped on Nagasaki .
While von Neumann did not originate the " implosion " concept , he was one of its most persistent proponents , encouraging its continued development against the instincts of many of his colleagues , who felt such a design to be unworkable .
He also eventually came up with the idea of using more powerful shaped charges and less fissionable material to greatly increase the speed of " assembly " .
When it turned out that there would not be enough uranium-235 to make more than one bomb , the implosive lens project was greatly expanded and von Neumann 's idea was implemented .
His calculations showed that implosion would work if it did not depart by more than 5 % from spherical symmetry .
After a series of failed attempts with models , this was achieved by George Kistiakowsky , and the construction of the Trinity bomb was completed in July 1945 .

Along with four other scientists and various military personnel , von Neumann was included in the target selection committee responsible for choosing the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki as the first targets of the atomic bomb .
Von Neumann oversaw computations related to the expected size of the bomb blasts , estimated death tolls , and the distance above the ground at which the bombs should be detonated for optimum shock wave propagation and thus maximum effect .
The cultural capital Kyoto , which had been spared the bombing inflicted upon militarily significant cities , was von Neumann 's first choice , a selection seconded by Manhattan Project leader General Leslie Groves .
However , this target was dismissed by Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson .
On July 16 , 1945 , with numerous other Manhattan Project personnel , von Neumann was an eyewitness to the first atomic bomb blast , code named Trinity , conducted as a test of the implosion method device , at the bombing range near Alamogordo Army Airfield , 35 miles ( 56 km ) southeast of Socorro , New Mexico .

The actual power of the explosion had been between 20 and 22 kilotons .
He then collaborated with Klaus Fuchs on further development of the bomb , and in 1946 the two filed a secret patent on " Improvement in Methods and Means for Utilizing Nuclear Energy " , which outlined a scheme for using a fission bomb to compress fusion fuel to initiate nuclear fusion .

The Fuchs – von Neumann work was passed on , by Fuchs , to the Soviet Union as part of his nuclear espionage , but it was not used in the Soviets ' own , independent development of the Teller – Ulam design .
In 1950 , von Neumann became a consultant to the Weapons Systems Evaluation Group ( --OOV-- ) , whose function was to advise the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the United States Secretary of Defense on the development and use of new technologies .
He also became an adviser to the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project ( --OOV-- ) , which was responsible for the military aspects on nuclear weapons .
Over the following two years , he also became a consultant to the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , a member of the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission , a consultant to the newly established Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory , and a member of the Scientific Advisory Group of the United States Air Force .
In 1955 , von Neumann became a commissioner of the AEC .
He accepted this position and used it to further the production of compact hydrogen bombs suitable for Intercontinental ballistic missile delivery .
He was adamant that H - bombs delivered into the heart of enemy territory by an ICBM would be the most effective weapon possible , and that the relative inaccuracy of the missile would n't be a problem with an H - bomb .
Despite his disagreement with Oppenheimer over the need for a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb , he testified on the latter 's behalf at the 1954 Oppenheimer security hearing , at which he asserted that Oppenheimer was loyal , and praised him for his helpfulness once the program went ahead .
Its purpose was to decide on the feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a thermonuclear weapon .
Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable , they could be overcome in time .
The --OOV-- Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959 , two years after his death .
Von Neumann is credited with the equilibrium strategy of mutual assured destruction , providing the deliberately humorous acronym , MAD .
His goal was to quickly develop ICBMs and the compact hydrogen bombs that they could deliver to the USSR , and he knew the Soviets were doing similar work because the CIA interviewed German rocket scientists who were allowed to return to Germany , and von Neumann had planted a dozen technical people in the CIA .
The Russians believed that bombers would soon be vulnerable , and they shared von Neumann 's view that an H - bomb in an ICBM was the ne plus ultra of weapons , and they believed that whoever had superiority in these weapons would take over the world , without necessarily using them .
He was afraid of a " missile gap " and took several more steps to achieve his goal of keeping up with the Soviets :
Von Neumann entered government service ( Manhattan Project ) primarily because he felt that , if freedom and civilization were to survive , it would have to be because the US would triumph over totalitarianism from Nazism , Fascism and Soviet Communism .
During a Senate committee hearing he described his political ideology as " violently anti - communist , and much more militaristic than the norm " .

Von Neumann was a founding figure in computing .
He also worked on the philosophy of artificial intelligence with Alan Turing when the latter visited Princeton in the 1930s .
Donald Knuth cites von Neumann as the inventor , in 1945 , of the merge sort algorithm , in which the first and second halves of an array are each sorted recursively and then merged .
Von Neumann 's hydrogen bomb work was played out in the realm of computing , where he and Stanislaw Ulam developed simulations on von Neumann 's digital computers for the hydrodynamic computations .
During this time he contributed to the development of the Monte Carlo method , which allowed solutions to complicated problems to be approximated using random numbers .
Because using lists of " truly " random numbers was extremely slow , von Neumann developed a form of making pseudorandom numbers , using the middle - square method .
While consulting for the Moore School of Electrical Engineering at the University of Pennsylvania on the EDVAC project , von Neumann wrote an incomplete First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC .
This architecture is to this day the basis of modern computer design , unlike the earliest computers that were " programmed " using a separate memory device such as a paper tape or plugboard .
Although the single - memory , stored program architecture is commonly called von Neumann architecture as a result of von Neumann 's paper , the architecture 's description was based on the work of J. Presper Eckert and John William Mauchly , inventors of the ENIAC computer at the University of Pennsylvania .
The electronics of the new ENIAC ran at one - sixth the speed , but this in no way degraded the ENIAC 's performance , since it was still entirely I / O bound .
Complicated programs could be developed and debugged in days rather than the weeks required for --OOV-- the old ENIAC .
He arranged its financing , and the components were designed and built at the RCA Research Laboratory nearby .
Stochastic computing was first introduced in a pioneering paper by von Neumann in 1953 .
However , the theory could not be implemented until advances in computing of the 1960s . He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers , constructing the first self - replicating automata with pencil and graph paper .
Beginning in 1949 , von Neumann 's design for a self - reproducing computer program is considered the world 's first computer virus , and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology .

Noting that the Earth was only 6 ° F ( 3.3 ° C ) colder during the last glacial period , he noted that the burning of coal and oil " a general warming of the Earth by about one degree Fahrenheit .
Von Neumann 's ability to instantaneously perform complex operations in his head stunned other mathematicians .
" Paul Halmos states that " von Neumann 's speed was awe - inspiring . " Israel Halperin said : " Keeping up with him was ... impossible .
Most people avoid thinking if they can , some of us are addicted to thinking , but von Neumann actually enjoyed thinking , maybe even to the exclusion of everything else . "
Lothar Wolfgang Nordheim described von Neumann as the " fastest mind I ever met " , and Jacob Bronowski wrote " He was the cleverest man I ever knew , without exception .

Herman Goldstine wrote : " One of his remarkable abilities was his power of absolute recall . As far as I could tell , von Neumann was able on once reading a book or article to quote it back verbatim ; moreover , he could do it years later without hesitation .
Whereupon , without any pause , he immediately began to recite the first chapter and continued until asked to stop after about ten or fifteen minutes . " Ulam noted that von Neumann 's way of thinking might not be visual , but more of an aural one .

" I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann 's does not indicate a species superior to that of man " , said Nobel Laureate Hans Bethe of Cornell University .
" James Glimm wrote : " he is regarded as one of the giants of modern mathematics " .
The mathematician Jean Dieudonné called von Neumann " the last of the great mathematicians " , while Peter Lax described him as possessing the " most scintillating intellect of this century " .
In 1955 , von Neumann was diagnosed with what was either bone or pancreatic cancer .
His mother , Margaret von Neumann , was diagnosed with cancer in 1956 and died within two weeks .
John had eighteen months from diagnosis till death .
Father Strittmatter administered the last sacraments to him .
" Father Strittmatter recalled that von Neumann did not receive much peace or comfort from it , as he still remained terrified of death .
" " Of this deathbed conversion , Morgenstern told Heims , " He was of course completely agnostic all his life , and then he suddenly turned Catholic — it does n't agree with anything whatsoever in his attitude , outlook and thinking when he was healthy .
Some of von Neumann 's friends ( such as Abraham Pais and Oskar Morgenstern ) said they had always believed him to be " completely agnostic . " " Of this deathbed conversion , Morgenstern told Heims , " He was of course completely agnostic all his life , and then he suddenly turned Catholic — it does n't agree with anything whatsoever in his attitude , outlook and thinking when he was healthy .
Diarrhea , also spelled diarrhoea , is the condition of having at least three loose or liquid bowel movements each day .
It often lasts for a few days and can result in dehydration due to fluid loss .
Signs of dehydration often begin with loss of the normal stretchiness of the skin and irritable behaviour .
This can progress to decreased urination , loss of skin color , a fast heart rate , and a decrease in responsiveness as it becomes more severe .
The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus , bacteria , or parasite ; a condition known as gastroenteritis .
The most common cause is an infection of the intestines due to either a virus , bacteria , or parasite ; a condition known as gastroenteritis .
It may be divided into three types : short duration watery diarrhea , short duration bloody diarrhea , and if it lasts for more than two weeks , persistent diarrhea .
If blood is present it is also known as dysentery .
Prevention of infectious diarrhea is by improved sanitation , clean drinking water , and hand washing with soap .
Breastfeeding for at least six months is also recommended as is vaccination against rotavirus .
Oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) , which is clean water with modest amounts of salts and sugar , is the treatment of choice .
Antibiotics , while rarely used , may be recommended in a few cases such as those who have bloody diarrhea and a high fever , those with severe diarrhea following travelling , and those who grow specific bacteria or parasites in their stool .
About 1.7 to 5 billion cases of diarrhea occur per year .
It is most common in developing countries , where young children get diarrhea on average three times a year .
Frequent episodes of diarrhea are also a common cause of malnutrition and the most common cause in those younger than five years of age .
Other long term problems that can result include stunted growth and poor intellectual development .
Secretory diarrhea means that there is an increase in the active secretion , or there is an inhibition of absorption .
The most common cause of this type of diarrhea is a cholera toxin that stimulates the secretion of anions , especially chloride ions .
Secretory diarrhea means that there is an increase in the active secretion , or there is an inhibition of absorption . There is little to no structural damage . The most common cause of this type of diarrhea is a cholera toxin that stimulates the secretion of anions , especially chloride ions .
Osmotic diarrhea occurs when too much water is drawn into the bowels .
If a person drinks solutions with excessive sugar or excessive salt , these can draw water from the body into the bowel and cause osmotic diarrhea .
Or it can be caused by osmotic laxatives ( which work to alleviate constipation by drawing water into the bowels ) .
In healthy individuals , too much magnesium or vitamin C or undigested lactose can produce osmotic diarrhea and distention of the bowel .
Inflammatory diarrhea occurs when there is damage to the mucosal lining or brush border , which leads to a passive loss of protein - rich fluids and a decreased ability to absorb these lost fluids .

It can be caused by bacterial infections , viral infections , parasitic infections , or autoimmune problems such as inflammatory bowel diseases .
It can also be caused by tuberculosis , colon cancer , and --OOV-- needed ]
Diarrheal disease may have a negative impact on both physical fitness and mental development .
" Early childhood malnutrition resulting from any cause reduces physical fitness and work productivity in adults , " and diarrhea is a primary cause of childhood malnutrition .
" Early childhood malnutrition resulting from any cause reduces physical fitness and work productivity in adults , " and diarrhea is a primary cause of childhood malnutrition .
Further , evidence suggests that diarrheal disease has significant impacts on mental development and health ; it has been shown that , even when controlling for helminth infection and early breastfeeding , children who had experienced severe diarrhea had significantly lower scores on a series of tests of intelligence .
Another possible cause of diarrhea is irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , which usually presents with abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation and unusual stool ( diarrhea or constipation ) for at least 3 days a week over the previous 3 months .
Another possible cause of diarrhea is irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , which usually presents with abdominal discomfort relieved by defecation and unusual stool ( diarrhea or constipation ) for at least 3 days a week over the previous 3 months .
Symptoms of diarrhea - predominant IBS can be managed through a combination of dietary changes , soluble fiber supplements , and/or medications such as loperamide or codeine .
Poverty is a good indicator of the rate of infectious diarrhea in a population .
This association does not stem from poverty itself , but rather from the conditions under which impoverished people live .
The impact is exacerbated by the lack of adequate , available , and affordable medical care . "
Proper nutrition is important for health and functioning , including the prevention of infectious diarrhea .
Children who have lowered levels of zinc have a greater number of instances of diarrhea , severe diarrhea , and diarrhea associated with fever .
Similarly , vitamin A deficiency can cause an increase in the severity of diarrheal episodes , however there is some discrepancy when it comes to the impact of vitamin A deficiency on the rate of disease .
Given that estimates suggest 127 million preschool children worldwide are vitamin A deficient , this population has the potential for increased risk of disease contraction .
According to two researchers , Nesse and Williams , diarrhea may function as an evolved expulsion defense mechanism .
As a result , if it is stopped , there might be a delay in recovery . They cite in support of this argument research published in 1973 that found that treating Shigella with the anti - diarrhea drug ( Co - --OOV-- , Lomotil ) caused people to stay feverish twice as long as those not so treated .

The researchers indeed themselves observed that : " Lomotil may be contraindicated in shigellosis .
Basic sanitation techniques can have a profound effect on the transmission of diarrheal disease .
The implementation of hand washing using soap and water , for example , has been experimentally shown to reduce the incidence of disease by approximately --OOV-- % .
Hand washing in developing countries , however , is compromised by poverty as acknowledged by the CDC : " Handwashing is integral to disease prevention in all parts of the world ; however , access to soap and water is limited in a number of less developed countries .
" Solutions to this barrier require the implementation of educational programs that encourage sanitary behaviours .
Given that water contamination is a major means of transmitting diarrheal disease , efforts to provide clean water supply and improved sanitation have the potential to dramatically cut the rate of disease incidence .

Similarly , a meta - analysis of numerous studies on improving water supply and sanitation shows a --OOV-- % reduction in disease incidence , and a --OOV-- % reduction in mortality rate associated with diarrheal disease .
Immunization against the pathogens that cause diarrheal disease is a viable prevention strategy , however it does require targeting certain pathogens for vaccination .
In the case of Rotavirus , which was responsible for around 6 % of diarrheal episodes and 20 % of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries , use of a Rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight ( 2 - 3 % ) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence , while reducing overall mortality by 6 - 10 % .

Dietary deficiencies in developing countries can be combated by promoting better eating practices .
Zinc supplementation proved successful showing a significant decrease in the incidence of diarrheal disease compared to a control group .
Development of a supplementation strategy should take into consideration the fact that vitamin A supplementation was less effective in reducing diarrhea incidence when compared to vitamin A and zinc supplementation , and that the latter strategy was estimated to be significantly more cost effective .
In many cases of diarrhea , replacing lost fluid and salts is the only treatment needed .
This is usually by mouth – oral rehydration therapy – or , in severe cases , intravenously .
Diet restrictions such as the BRAT diet are no longer recommended .
To the contrary , WHO recommends that children with diarrhea continue to eat as sufficient nutrients are usually still absorbed to support continued growth and weight gain , and that continuing to eat also speeds up recovery of normal intestinal functioning .
Oral rehydration solution ( ORS ) ( a slightly sweetened and salty water ) can be used to prevent dehydration .
Standard home solutions such as salted rice water , salted yogurt drinks , vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given .
There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte , and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar .
A WHO publication for physicians recommends a homemade ORS consisting of one liter water with one teaspoon salt ( 3 grams ) and two tablespoons sugar ( 18 grams ) added ( approximately the " taste of tears " ) .
Drinks especially high in simple sugars , such as soft drinks and fruit juices , are not recommended in children under 5 years of age as they may increase dehydration .
A too rich solution in the gut draws water from the rest of the body , just as if the person were to drink sea water .
A nasogastric tube can be used in young children to administer fluids if warranted .
WHO recommends a child with diarrhea continue to be fed .
Continued feeding speeds the recovery of normal intestinal function .
In contrast , children whose food is restricted have diarrhea of longer duration and recover intestinal function more slowly .
While antibiotics are beneficial in certain types of acute diarrhea , they are usually not used except in specific situations .
There are concerns that antibiotics may increase the risk of hemolytic uremic syndrome in people infected with Escherichia coli --OOV-- .
However , some bacteria are developing antibiotic resistance , particularly Shigella .

To make pulp from wood , a chemical pulping process separates lignin from cellulose fibres .
Paper made from chemical pulps are also known as wood - free papers – not to be confused with tree - free paper ; this is because they do not contain lignin , which deteriorates over time .
The pulp can also be bleached to produce white paper , but this consumes 5 % of the fibres ; chemical pulping processes are not used to make paper made from cotton , which is already 90 % cellulose .

The kraft process , invented in the 1870s and first used in the 1890s , is now the most commonly practiced strategy , one of its advantages is the chemical reaction with lignin , that produces heat , which can be used to run a generator .
Soda pulping is another specialty process used to pulp straws , bagasse and hardwoods with high silicate content .
There are two major mechanical pulps , the thermomechanical one ( TMP ) and groundwood pulp ( GW ) .
In the groundwood process , debarked logs are fed into grinders where they are pressed against rotating stones to be made into fibres .
Mechanical pulps have rather short fibres , thus producing weak paper .
Recycled papers can be made from 100 % recycled materials or blended with virgin pulp , although they are ( generally ) not as strong nor as bright as papers made from the latter .
Besides the fibres , pulps may contain fillers such as chalk or china clay , which improve its characteristics for printing or writing .
Additives for sizing purposes may be mixed with it and/or applied to the paper web later in the manufacturing process ; the purpose of such sizing is to establish the correct level of surface absorbency to suit ink or paint .

Drying involves using air and/or heat to remove water from the paper sheets ; in the earliest days of paper making this was done by hanging the sheets like laundry ; in more modern times various forms of heated drying mechanisms are used .
These can reach temperatures above 200 ° F ( 93 ° C ) and are used in long sequences of more than 40 cans ; where the heat produced by these can easily dry the paper to less than 6 % moisture .
Coated paper has a thin layer of material such as calcium carbonate or china clay applied to one or both sides in order to create a surface more suitable for high - resolution halftone screens .

Paper may be between 0.07 and 0.18 millimetres ( 0.0028 and 0.0071 in ) thick .
Paper is often characterized by weight .
In the United States , the weight assigned to a paper is the weight of a ream , 500 sheets , of varying " basic sizes " , before the paper is cut into the size it is sold to end customers .
Cover stock is generally 68 lb , and 110 lb or more is considered card stock .
In Europe , and other regions using the ISO 216 paper sizing system , the weight is expressed in grammes per square metre ( g / m2 or usually just g ) of the paper .
Printing paper is generally between 60 g and 120 g. Anything heavier than 160 g is considered card .
The weight of a ream therefore depends on the dimensions of the paper and its thickness .

The ISO 216 system used in most other countries is based on the surface area of a sheet of paper , not on a sheet 's width and length .
It was first adopted in Germany in 1922 and generally spread as nations adopted the metric system .
The largest standard size paper is A0 ( A zero ) , measuring one square meter ( approx .
The ISO 216 system used in most other countries is based on the surface area of a sheet of paper , not on a sheet 's width and length .
Common sizes used in the office and the home are A4 and A3 ( A3 is the size of two A4 sheets ) .
The density of paper ranges from 250 kg / m3 ( 16 lb / cu ft ) for tissue paper to 1,500 kg / m3 ( 94 lb / cu ft ) for some speciality paper .
Printing paper is about 800 kg / m3 ( 50 lb / cu ft ) .
Alum was added to paper to assist in sizing , making it somewhat water resistant so that inks did not " run " or spread uncontrollably .

With almost twice the yield as chemical pulping , mechanical pulps is often cheaper .
Mechanical pulping yields almost a tonne of pulp per tonne of dry wood used , which is why mechanical pulps are sometimes referred to as " high yield " pulps .
Book publishers tend to use acid - free paper , made from fully bleached chemical pulps for hardback and trade paperback books .

In the classical era , several ancient city - states such as --OOV-- , --OOV-- , --OOV-- , Nikon , --OOV-- , Damo and --OOV-- near Cape --OOV-- , which competed with the Sabaeans , Parthians and --OOV-- for the wealthy Indo - Greco - Roman trade , also flourished in Somalia .

With the migration of fleeing Muslim families from the Islamic world to Somalia in the early centuries of Islam and the peaceful conversion of the Somali population by Somali Muslim scholars in the following centuries , the ancient city - states eventually transformed into Islamic Mogadishu , Berbera , Zeila , --OOV-- and Merca , which were part of the --OOV-- civilization .
The city of Mogadishu came to be known as the City of Islam , and controlled the East African gold trade for several centuries .

Its army numbered 15,000 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers .
The historian al - Umari records that Ifat was situated near the Red Sea coast , and states its size as 15 days travel by 20 days travel .
In the Middle Ages , several powerful Somali empires dominated the regional trade including the --OOV-- Sultanate , which excelled in hydraulic engineering and fortress building , the Sultanate of Adal , whose general Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al - Ghazi ( Ahmed --OOV-- ) was the first commander to use cannon warfare on the continent during Adal 's conquest of the Ethiopian Empire , and the Sultanate of the --OOV-- , whose military dominance forced governors of the Omani empire north of the city of Lamu to pay tribute to the Somali Sultan Ahmed Yusuf .

As a result of its successes against the British , the Dervish State received support from the Ottoman and German empires .
After a quarter of a century of holding the British at bay , the Dervishes were finally defeated in 1920 , when Britain for the first time in Africa used airplanes to bomb the Dervish capital of --OOV-- .

Italy similarly faced the same opposition from Somali Sultans and armies and did not acquire full control of parts of modern Somalia until the Fascist era in late 1927 .
This occupation lasted till 1941 and was replaced by a British military administration .
Following World War II , Britain retained control of both British Somaliland and Italian Somaliland as protectorates .
In 1945 , during the Potsdam Conference , the United Nations granted Italy trusteeship of Italian Somaliland , but only under close supervision and on the condition — first proposed by the Somali Youth League ( SYL ) and other nascent Somali political organizations , such as --OOV-- --OOV-- --OOV-- Somali ( HDMS ) and the Somali National League ( SNL ) — that Somalia achieve independence within ten years .

British Somaliland remained a protectorate of Britain until 1960 .
Meanwhile , in 1948 , under pressure from their World War II allies and to the dismay of the Somalis , the British " returned " the Haud ( an important Somali grazing area that was presumably ' protected ' by British treaties with the Somalis in 1884 and 1886 ) and the Ogaden to Ethiopia , based on a treaty they signed in 1897 in which the British ceded Somali territory to the Ethiopian Emperor Menelik in exchange for his help against plundering by Somali clans .

This prompted an unsuccessful bid by Britain in 1956 to buy back the Somali lands it had turned over .
Britain also granted administration of the almost exclusively Somali - inhabited Northern Frontier District ( NFD ) to Kenyan nationalists despite an informal plebiscite demonstrating the overwhelming desire of the region 's population to join the newly formed Somali Republic .
A referendum was held in neighboring Djibouti ( then known as French Somaliland ) in 1958 , on the eve of Somalia 's independence in 1960 , to decide whether or not to join the Somali Republic or to remain with France .

The majority of those who voted no were Somalis who were strongly in favour of joining a united Somalia , as had been proposed by Mahmoud Harbi , Vice President of the Government Council .
Djibouti finally gained its independence from France in 1977 , and Hassan Gouled --OOV-- , a Somali who had campaigned for a yes vote in the referendum of 1958 , eventually wound up as Djibouti 's first president ( --OOV-- ) .

A government was formed by Abdullahi Issa Mohamud and Muhammad Haji Ibrahim Egal other members of the trusteeship and protectorate governments , with Haji Bashir Ismail Yusuf as President of the Somali National Assembly , Aden Abdullah Osman Daar as the President of the Somali Republic and Abdirashid Ali --OOV-- as Prime Minister ( later to become President from 1967 to 1969 ) .
On 15 October 1969 , while paying a visit to the northern town of Las Anod , Somalia 's then President Abdirashid Ali --OOV-- was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards .
On 15 October 1969 , while paying a visit to the northern town of Las Anod , Somalia 's then President Abdirashid Ali --OOV-- was shot dead by one of his own bodyguards .
His assassination was quickly followed by a military coup d'état on 21 October 1969 ( the day after his funeral ) , in which the Somali Army seized power without encountering armed opposition — essentially a bloodless takeover .
The putsch was spearheaded by Major General Mohamed Siad Barre , who at the time commanded the army .

That same year , Barre also served as chairman of the Organization of African Unity ( OAU ) , the predecessor of the African Union ( AU ) .
The revolutionary army established large - scale public works programs and successfully implemented an urban and rural literacy campaign , which helped dramatically increase the literacy rate .
Somali people in the Horn of Africa are divided among different countries ( Somalia , Djibouti , Ethiopia , and northeastern Kenya ) that were artificially and some might say arbitrarily partitioned by the former imperial powers .

Pan - --OOV-- is an ideology that advocates the unification of all ethnic Somalis once part of Somali empires such as the --OOV-- Empire , the Adal Sultanate , the --OOV-- Dynasty and the Dervish State under one flag and one nation .
The Siad Barre regime actively promoted Pan - --OOV-- , which eventually led to the Ogaden War between Somalia on one side , and Ethiopia , Cuba and the Soviet Union on the other .

( 2005 ) , Cruciani et al .
( 2004 , 2007 ) , the Somalis are paternally closely related to other Afro - Asiatic - speaking groups in Northeast Africa .
Besides comprising the majority of the Y - DNA in Somalis , the --OOV-- ( formerly --OOV-- ) haplogroup also makes up a significant proportion of the paternal DNA of Ethiopians , Sudanese , Egyptians , Berbers , North African Arabs , as well as many Mediterranean populations .
( 2007 ) , the presence of this --OOV-- in the Horn region may represent the traces of an ancient migration from Egypt / Libya .
( 2005 ) observed the M78 subclade of E1b1b in about 77 % of their Somali male samples .
( 2006 ) , a significant proportion of the maternal lineages of Somalis consists of the M1 haplogroup .
This mitochondrial clade is common among Ethiopians and North Africans , particularly Egyptians and Algerians .
M1 is believed to have originated in Asia , where its parent M clade represents the majority of mtDNA lineages .
According to mtDNA studies by Holden ( 2005 ) and Richards et al .
This haplogroup is also thought to possibly correlate with the Afro - Asiatic language family :
( 2014 ) , the Afro - Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral --OOV-- ) carrying a newly identified non - African genetic component , which the researchers dub the " Ethio - Somali " .
( 2014 ) , the Afro - Asiatic languages were likely spread across Africa and the Near East by an ancestral --OOV-- ) carrying a newly identified non - African genetic component , which the researchers dub the " Ethio - Somali " .
It reaches a frequency peak among ethnic Somalis , representing the majority of their ancestry .
The Ethio - Somali component is most closely related to the Maghrebi non - African genetic component , and is believed to have diverged from all other non - African ancestries at least 23,000 years ago .
On this basis , the researchers suggest that the original Ethio - Somali carrying --OOV-- ) probably arrived in the pre - agricultural period from the Near East , having crossed over into northeastern Africa via the Sinai Peninsula .

--OOV-- schools ( also known as --OOV-- ) remain the basic system of traditional religious instruction in Somalia .
A study from 1993 found , among other things , that " unlike in primary schools where gender disparity is enormous , around 40 per cent of --OOV-- school pupils are girls ; but the teaching staff have minimum or no qualification necessary to ensure intellectual development of children .
" To address these concerns , the Somali government on its own part subsequently established the Ministry of Endowment and Islamic Affairs , under which --OOV-- education is now regulated .
In the Somali diaspora , multiple Islamic fundraising events are held every year in cities like Birmingham , London , Toronto and Minneapolis , where Somali scholars and professionals give lectures and answer questions from the audience .
The purpose of these events is usually to raise money for new schools or universities in Somalia , to help Somalis that have suffered as a consequence of floods and/or droughts , or to gather funds for the creation of new mosques like the --OOV-- - As - Saddique Mosque , which is currently undergoing construction in the Twin cities .

In addition , the Somali community has produced numerous important Muslim figures over the centuries , many of whom have significantly shaped the course of Islamic learning and practice in the Horn of Africa , the Arabian Peninsula and well beyond .
The clan groupings of the Somali people are important social units , and clan membership plays a central part in Somali culture and politics .
The tombs of the founders of the Darod , Dir and Isaaq major clans as well as the --OOV-- sub - clan of the Hawiye are all located in northern Somalia .

So to extend ties of alliance , marriage is often to another ethnic Somali from a different clan .
Thus , for example , a recent study observed that in 89 marriages contracted by men of the Dhulbahante clan , 55 ( 62 % ) were with women of Dhulbahante sub - clans other than those of their husbands ; 30 ( 33.7 % ) were with women of surrounding clans of other clan families ( Isaaq , 28 ; Hawiye , 3 ) ; and 3 ( 4.3 % ) were with women of other clans of the Darod clan family ( --OOV-- 2 , Ogaden 1 ) .

The 1975 Somali Family Law gave men and women equal division of property between the husband and wife upon divorce and the exclusive right to control by each spouse over his or her personal property .
In 1975 , the most prominent government reforms regarding family law in a Muslim country were set in motion in the Somali Democratic Republic , which put women and men , including husbands and wives , on complete equal footing .

Statistics Canada 's 2006 census ranks people of Somali descent as the 69th largest ethnic group in Canada .
While the distribution of Somalis per country in Europe is hard to measure because the Somali community on the continent has grown so quickly in recent years , an official 2010 estimate reported 108,000 Somalis living in the United Kingdom .
Somalis in Britain are largely concentrated in the cities of London , Sheffield , Bristol , Birmingham , Cardiff , Liverpool , Manchester , Leeds , and Leicester , with London alone accounting for roughly 78 % of Britain 's Somali population .

At first listen , Somali music might be mistaken for the sounds of nearby regions such as Ethiopia , Sudan or Arabia , but it is ultimately recognizable by its own unique tunes and styles .
Somali songs are usually the product of collaboration between lyricists ( --OOV-- ) , songwriters ( lahan ) and singers ( ' --OOV-- or " voice " ) .
Growing out of the Somali people 's rich storytelling tradition , the first few feature - length Somali films and cinematic festivals emerged in the early 1960s , immediately after independence .

The history of science is the study of the development of science and scientific knowledge , including both the natural sciences and social sciences .
( The history of the arts and humanities is termed as the history of scholarship .
) Science is a body of empirical , theoretical , and practical knowledge about the natural world , produced by scientists who emphasize the observation , explanation , and prediction of real world phenomena .
Historiography of science , in contrast , often draws on the historical methods of both intellectual history and social history .

Thales ' student Pythagoras of Samos founded the Pythagorean school , which investigated mathematics for its own sake , and was the first to postulate that the Earth is spherical in shape .
Subsequently , Plato and Aristotle produced the first systematic discussions of natural philosophy , which did much to shape later investigations of nature .
Their development of deductive reasoning was of particular importance and usefulness to later scientific inquiry .
Plato founded the Platonic Academy in 387 BC , whose motto was " Let none unversed in geometry enter here " , and turned out many notable philosophers .
Plato 's student Aristotle introduced empiricism and the notion that universal truths can be arrived at via observation and induction , thereby laying the foundations of the scientific method .
He made countless observations of nature , especially the habits and attributes of plants and animals in the world around him , classified more than 540 animal species , and dissected at least 50 .
The important legacy of this period included substantial advances in factual knowledge , especially in anatomy , zoology , botany , mineralogy , geography , mathematics and astronomy ; an awareness of the importance of certain scientific problems , especially those related to the problem of change and its causes ; and a recognition of the methodological importance of applying mathematics to natural phenomena and of undertaking empirical research .
In the Hellenistic age scholars frequently employed the principles developed in earlier Greek thought : the application of mathematics and deliberate empirical research , in their scientific investigations .
Neither reason nor inquiry began with the Ancient Greeks , but the Socratic method did , along with the idea of Forms , great advances in geometry , logic , and the natural sciences .

Seismology : To better prepare for calamities , Zhang Heng invented a seismometer in 132 CE which provided instant alert to authorities in the capital Luoyang that an earthquake had occurred in a location indicated by a specific cardinal or ordinal direction .
Although no tremors could be felt in the capital when Zhang told the court that an earthquake had just occurred in the northwest , a message came soon afterwards that an earthquake had indeed struck 400 km ( 248 mi ) to 500 km ( 310 mi ) northwest of Luoyang ( in what is now modern Gansu ) .
Zhang called his device the ' instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth ' ( --OOV-- --OOV-- yi --OOV-- ) , so - named because he and others thought that earthquakes were most likely caused by the enormous compression of trapped air .

With the division of the Roman Empire , the Western Roman Empire lost contact with much of its past .
In the Middle East , Greek philosophy was able to find some support under the newly created Arab Empire .
With the spread of Islam in the 7th and 8th centuries , a period of Muslim scholarship , known as the Islamic Golden Age , lasted until the 13th century .

The use of a single language , Arabic , allowed communication without need of a translator .
Muslim scientists placed far greater emphasis on experiment than had the Greeks .
This led to an early scientific method being developed in the Muslim world , where significant progress in methodology was made , beginning with the experiments of Ibn al - Haytham ( Alhazen ) on optics from c. 1000 , in his Book of Optics .
The law of refraction of light was known to the Persians .
Ibn al - Haytham is also regarded as the father of optics , especially for his empirical proof of the intromission theory of light .

Sabian mathematician Al - Battani ( 850 - 929 ) contributed to astronomy and mathematics , while Persian scholar Al - Razi contributed to chemistry and medicine .
In astronomy , Al - Battani improved the measurements of Hipparchus , preserved in the translation of Ptolemy 's Hè --OOV-- Syntaxis ( The great treatise ) translated as Almagest .

Al - Battani also improved the precision of the measurement of the precession of the Earth 's axis .
The corrections made to the geocentric model by al - Battani , Ibn al - Haytham , Averroes and the Maragha astronomers such as Nasir al - Din al - Tusi , --OOV-- --OOV-- and Ibn al - --OOV-- are similar to Copernican heliocentric model .
Ibn Sina ( Avicenna ) is regarded as the most influential philosopher of Islam .
He pioneered the science of experimental medicine and was the first physician to conduct clinical trials .
His two most notable works in medicine are the Kitāb al - --OOV-- ( " Book of Healing " ) and The Canon of Medicine , both of which were used as standard medicinal texts in both the Muslim world and in Europe well into the 17th century .

Amongst his many contributions are the discovery of the contagious nature of infectious diseases , and the introduction of clinical pharmacology .
An intellectual revitalization of Europe started with the birth of medieval universities in the 12th century .
European scholars had access to the translation programs of Raymond of Toledo , who sponsored the 12th century Toledo School of Translators from Arabic to Latin .

Later translators like Michael Scotus would learn Arabic in order to study these texts directly .
At the beginning of the 13th century , there were reasonably accurate Latin translations of the main works of almost all the intellectually crucial ancient authors , allowing a sound transfer of scientific ideas via both the universities and the monasteries .
Precursors of the modern scientific method , influenced by earlier contributions of the Islamic world , can be seen already in Grosseteste 's emphasis on mathematics as a way to understand nature , and in the empirical approach admired by Bacon , particularly in his Opus Majus .

Pierre Duhem 's provocative thesis of the Catholic Church 's Condemnation of 1277 led to the study of medieval science as a serious discipline , " but no one in the field any longer endorses his view that modern science started in 1277 " .
However , many scholars agree with Duhem 's view that the Middle Ages were a period of important scientific developments .
William of Ockham introduced the principle of parsimony : natural philosophers should not postulate unnecessary entities , so that motion is not a distinct thing but is only the moving object and an intermediary " sensible species " is not needed to transmit an image of an object to the eye .
In particular , Buridan developed the theory that impetus was the cause of the motion of projectiles , which was a first step towards the modern concept of inertia .

The Oxford Calculators began to mathematically analyze the kinematics of motion , making this analysis without considering the causes of motion .
In 1348 , the Black Death and other disasters sealed a sudden end to the previous period of massive philosophic and scientific development .
Yet , the rediscovery of ancient texts was improved after the Fall of Constantinople in 1453 , when many Byzantine scholars had to seek refuge in the West .
Meanwhile , the introduction of printing was to have great effect on European society .
The facilitated dissemination of the printed word democratized learning and allowed a faster propagation of new ideas .
New ideas also helped to influence the development of European science at this point : not least the introduction of Algebra .
The renewal of learning in Europe , that began with 12th century Scholasticism , came to an end about the time of the Black Death , and the initial period of the subsequent Italian Renaissance is sometimes seen as a lull in scientific activity .

The Northern Renaissance , on the other hand , showed a decisive shift in focus from --OOV-- natural philosophy to chemistry and the biological sciences ( botany , anatomy , and medicine ) .
Work by Vesalius on human cadavers found problems with the Galenic view of anatomy .
The willingness to question previously held truths and search for new answers resulted in a period of major scientific advancements , now known as the Scientific Revolution .
The Scientific Revolution is traditionally held by most historians to have begun in 1543 , when the books De humani corporis fabrica ( On the Workings of the Human Body ) by Andreas Vesalius , and also De Revolutionibus , by the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus , were first printed .

The thesis of Copernicus ' book was that the Earth moved around the Sun .
The period culminated with the publication of the --OOV-- Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687 by Isaac Newton , representative of the unprecedented growth of scientific publications throughout Europe .
The 17th century " Age of Reason " opened the avenues to the decisive steps towards modern science , which took place during the 18th century " Age of Enlightenment " .
The impact of this process was not limited to science and technology , but affected philosophy ( Immanuel Kant , David Hume ) , religion ( the increasingly significant impact of science upon religion ) , and society and politics in general ( Adam Smith , Voltaire ) , the French Revolution of 1789 setting a bloody --OOV-- indicating the beginning of political --OOV-- needed ] .
Directly based on the works of Newton , Descartes , Pascal and Leibniz , the way was now clear to the development of modern mathematics , physics and technology by the generation of Benjamin Franklin ( --OOV-- ) , Leonhard Euler ( --OOV-- ) , Mikhail Lomonosov ( --OOV-- ) and Jean le Rond d'Alembert ( --OOV-- ) , epitomized in the appearance of Denis Diderot 's Encyclopédie between 1751 and 1772 .
The Romantic Movement of the early 19th century reshaped science by opening up new pursuits unexpected in the classical approaches of the Enlightenment .
Major breakthroughs came in biology , especially in Darwin 's theory of evolution , as well as physics ( electromagnetism ) , mathematics ( non - Euclidean geometry , group theory ) and chemistry ( organic chemistry ) .

The scientific revolution is a convenient boundary between ancient thought and classical physics .
Nicolaus Copernicus revived the heliocentric model of the solar system described by Aristarchus of Samos .
This was followed by the first known model of planetary motion given by Johannes Kepler in the early 17th century , which proposed that the planets follow elliptical orbits , with the Sun at one focus of the ellipse .

Galileo ( " Father of Modern Physics " ) also made use of experiments to validate physical theories , a key element of the scientific method .
In 1687 , Isaac Newton published the Principia Mathematica , detailing two comprehensive and successful physical theories : Newton 's laws of motion , which led to classical mechanics ; and Newton 's Law of Gravitation , which describes the fundamental force of gravity .

These studies led to the unification of the two phenomena into a single theory of electromagnetism , by James Clerk Maxwell ( known as Maxwell 's equations ) .
Beginning in 1900 , Max Planck , Albert Einstein , Niels Bohr and others developed quantum theories to explain various anomalous experimental results , by introducing discrete energy levels .
Not only did quantum mechanics show that the laws of motion did not hold on small scales , but even more disturbingly , the theory of general relativity , proposed by Einstein in 1915 , showed that the fixed background of spacetime , on which both Newtonian mechanics and special relativity depended , could not exist .
In 1925 , Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schrödinger formulated quantum mechanics , which explained the preceding quantum theories .
The observation by Edwin Hubble in 1929 that the speed at which galaxies recede positively correlates with their distance , led to the understanding that the universe is expanding , and the formulation of the Big Bang theory by Georges Lemaître .

Further developments took place during World War II , which led to the practical application of radar and the development and use of the atomic bomb .
Though the process had begun with the invention of the cyclotron by Ernest O. Lawrence in the 1930s , physics in the postwar period entered into a phase of what historians have called " Big Science " , requiring massive machines , budgets , and laboratories in order to test their theories and move into new frontiers .
Currently , general relativity and quantum mechanics are inconsistent with each other , and efforts are underway to unify the two .
Modern chemistry emerged from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries through the material practices and theories promoted by alchemy , medicine , manufacturing and mining .
A decisive moment came when ' --OOV-- ' was distinguished from alchemy by Robert Boyle in his work The Sceptical Chymist , in 1661 ; although the alchemical tradition continued for some time after his work .

The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth 's petrochemicals , after the exhaustion of the oil supply from whaling .
Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in physiological chemistry , the precursor to biochemistry .
Linus Pauling 's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever - more complicated molecules .
Theophrastus ' work on rocks , Peri --OOV-- , remained authoritative for millennia : its interpretation of fossils was not overturned until after the Scientific Revolution .

Geology did not undergo systematic restructuring during the Scientific Revolution , but individual theorists made important contributions .
Robert Hooke , for example , formulated a theory of earthquakes , and Nicholas Steno developed the theory of superposition and argued that fossils were the remains of once - living creatures .

Beginning with Thomas Burnet 's Sacred Theory of the Earth in 1681 , natural philosophers began to explore the idea that the Earth had changed over time .
Burnet and his contemporaries interpreted Earth 's past in terms of events described in the Bible , but their work laid the intellectual foundations for secular interpretations of Earth history .
Benoît de Maillet and the Comte de Buffon saw the Earth as much older than the 6,000 years envisioned by biblical scholars .
Jean - Étienne --OOV-- and Nicolas Desmarest hiked central France and recorded their observations on some of the first geological maps .
Aided by chemical experimentation , naturalists such as Scotland 's John Walker , Sweden 's --OOV-- Bergman , and Germany 's Abraham Werner created comprehensive classification systems for rocks and minerals — a collective achievement that transformed geology into a cutting edge field by the end of the eighteenth century .
The use of index fossils became a powerful tool for making geological maps , because it allowed geologists to correlate the rocks in one locality with those of similar age in other , distant localities .
These early geologists also proposed a generalized interpretations of Earth history that led James Hutton , Georges Cuvier and Alexandre Brongniart , following in the steps of Steno , to argue that layers of rock could be dated by the fossils they contained : a principle first applied to the geology of the Paris Basin .
Midway through the 19th century , the focus of geology shifted from description and classification to attempts to understand how the surface of the Earth had changed .
Louis Agassiz and others established the reality of continent - covering ice ages , and " --OOV-- " like Andrew Crombie Ramsay argued that river valleys were formed , over millions of years by the rivers that flow through them .

After the discovery of radioactivity , radiometric dating methods were developed , starting in the 20th century .
In 1847 , Hungarian physician Ignác Fülöp Semmelweis dramatically reduced the --OOV-- of puerperal fever by simply requiring physicians to wash their hands before attending to women in childbirth .
In 1847 , Hungarian physician Ignác Fülöp Semmelweis dramatically reduced the --OOV-- of puerperal fever by simply requiring physicians to wash their hands before attending to women in childbirth .
This discovery predated the germ theory of disease .
However , Semmelweis ' findings were not appreciated by his contemporaries and came into use only with discoveries by British surgeon Joseph Lister , who in 1865 proved the principles of antisepsis .
Lister 's work was based on the important findings by French biologist Louis Pasteur .
Perhaps the most prominent , controversial and far - reaching theory in all of science has been the theory of evolution by natural selection put forward by the British naturalist Charles Darwin in his book On the Origin of Species in 1859 .

Implications of evolution on fields outside of pure science have led to both opposition and support from different parts of society , and profoundly influenced the popular understanding of " man 's place in the universe " .
In the early 20th century , the study of heredity became a major investigation after the rediscovery in 1900 of the laws of inheritance developed by the Moravian monk Gregor Mendel in 1866 .
By 1953 , James D. Watson , Francis Crick and Maurice Wilkins clarified the basic structure of DNA , the genetic material for expressing life in all its forms .
The discipline of ecology typically traces its origin to the synthesis of Darwinian evolution and --OOV-- biogeography , in the late 19th and early 20th centuries .
Equally important in the rise of ecology , however , were microbiology and soil science — particularly the cycle of life concept , prominent in the work Louis Pasteur and Ferdinand Cohn .
The word ecology was coined by Ernst Haeckel , whose particularly holistic view of nature in general ( and Darwin 's theory in particular ) was important in the spread of ecological thinking .
The history of ecology in the 20th century is closely tied to that of environmentalism ; the Gaia hypothesis , first formulated in the 1960s , and spreading in the 1970s , and more recently the scientific - religious movement of Deep Ecology have brought the two closer together .

Political science is a late arrival in terms of social --OOV-- needed ] .
The roots of politics are in prehistory .
In each historic period and in almost every geographic area , we can find someone studying politics and increasing political understanding .
In Western culture , the study of politics is first found in Ancient Greece .
Later , Plato analyzed political systems , abstracted their analysis from more --OOV-- and --OOV-- oriented studies and applied an approach we would understand as closer to philosophy .

Roger Boesche describes the --OOV-- as " a book of political realism , a book analysing how the political world does work and not very often stating how it ought to work , a book that frequently discloses to a king what calculating and sometimes brutal measures he must carry out to preserve the state and the common good .

With the fall of the Western Roman Empire , there arose a more diffuse arena for political studies .
The rise of monotheism and , particularly for the Western tradition , Christianity , brought to light a new space for politics and political --OOV-- needed ] .
During the Middle Ages , the study of politics was widespread in the churches and courts .
Works such as Augustine of Hippo 's The City of God synthesized current philosophies and political traditions with those of Christianity , redefining the borders between what was religious and what was political .

Historical linguistics emerged as an independent field of study at the end of the 18th century .
Sir William Jones proposed that Sanskrit , Persian , Greek , Latin , Gothic , and Celtic languages all shared a common base .
After Jones , an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century .
Noam Chomsky further diversified linguistics with the development of generative linguistics in the 1950s .
His effort is based upon a mathematical model of language that allows for the description and prediction of valid syntax .
The basis for classical economics forms Adam Smith 's An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations , published in 1776 .

Smith criticized mercantilism , advocating a system of free trade with division of labour .
He postulated an " invisible hand " that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self - interest .
Karl Marx developed an alternative economic theory , called Marxian economics .
In the 1920s , John Maynard Keynes prompted a division between microeconomics and macroeconomics .
Following World War II , Milton Friedman created the concept of monetarism .
Monetarism focuses on using the supply and demand of money as a method for controlling economic activity .
In the 1970s , monetarism has adapted into supply - side economics which advocates reducing taxes as a means to increase the amount of money available for economic expansion .

The opening passage of the " Wealth " containing Smith 's message is never mentioned as it can not be integrated into modern theory : " Wealth " depends on the division of labour which changes with market volume and on the proportion of productive to Unproductive labor .
The end of the 19th century marks the start of psychology as a scientific enterprise .
The year 1879 is commonly seen as the start of psychology as an independent field of study .
In that year Wilhelm Wundt founded the first laboratory dedicated exclusively to psychological research ( in Leipzig ) .
Other important early contributors to the field include Hermann Ebbinghaus ( a pioneer in memory studies ) , Ivan Pavlov ( who discovered classical conditioning ) , William James , and Sigmund Freud .

The final decades of the 20th century have seen the rise of a new interdisciplinary approach to studying human psychology , known collectively as cognitive science .
Cognitive science again considers the mind as a subject for investigation , using the tools of psychology , linguistics , computer science , philosophy , and neurobiology .
New methods of visualizing the activity of the brain , such as PET scans and CAT scans , began to exert their influence as well , leading some researchers to investigate the mind by investigating the brain , rather than cognition .
These new forms of investigation assume that a wide understanding of the human mind is possible , and that such an understanding may be applied to other research domains , such as artificial intelligence .
Ibn Khaldun can be regarded as the earliest scientific systematic sociologist .
The modern sociology , emerged in the early 19th century as the academic response to the modernization of the world .
Among many early sociologists ( e.g. , Émile Durkheim ) , the aim of sociology was in structuralism , understanding the cohesion of social groups , and developing an " antidote " to social disintegration .
Max Weber was concerned with the modernization of society through the concept of rationalization , which he believed would trap individuals in an " iron cage " of rational thought .
American sociology in the 1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by Talcott Parsons , who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore " functional " .
American sociology in the 1940s and 1950s was dominated largely by Talcott Parsons , who argued that aspects of society that promoted structural integration were therefore " functional " .
This structural functionalism approach was questioned in the 1960s , when sociologists came to see this approach as merely a justification for inequalities present in the status quo .
In reaction , conflict theory was developed , which was based in part on the philosophies of Karl Marx .
Conflict theorists saw society as an arena in which different groups compete for control over resources .
Computer science , built upon a foundation of theoretical linguistics , discrete mathematics , and electrical engineering , studies the nature and limits of computation .
One area in which advances in computing have contributed to more general scientific development is by facilitating large - scale archiving of scientific data .
Contemporary computer science typically distinguishes itself by emphasising mathematical ' theory ' in contrast to the practical emphasis of software engineering .
As an academic field , history of science began with the publication of William Whewell 's History of the Inductive Sciences ( first published in 1837 ) .
A more formal study of the history of science as an independent discipline was launched by George Sarton 's publications , Introduction to the History of Science ( 1927 ) and the Isis journal ( founded in 1912 ) .
Sarton exemplified the early 20th - century view of the history of science as the history of great men and great ideas .
He shared with many of his contemporaries a Whiggish belief in history as a record of the advances and delays in the march of progress .
The history of science was not a recognized subfield of American history in this period , and most of the work was carried out by interested scientists and physicians rather than professional historians .
Much of the study of the history of science has been devoted to answering questions about what science is , how it functions , and whether it exhibits large - scale patterns and trends .
The sociology of science in particular has focused on the ways in which scientists work , looking closely at the ways in which they " produce " and " construct " scientific knowledge .
Since the 1960s , a common trend in science studies ( the study of the sociology and history of science ) has been to emphasize the " human component " of scientific knowledge , and to de - emphasize the view that scientific data are self - evident , value - free , and context - free .
--OOV-- science refers to the early 19th century approach of combining scientific field work with the age of Romanticism sensitivity , ethics and aesthetic ideals .
It helped to install natural history as a separate field , gave base for ecology and was based on the role model of scientist , naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt .
The later 19th century positivism asserted that all authentic knowledge allows verification and that all authentic knowledge assumes that the only valid knowledge is scientific .
The mid 20th century saw a series of studies relying to the role of science in a social context , starting from Thomas Kuhn 's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962 .
It opened the study of science to new disciplines by suggesting that the evolution of science was in part sociologically determined and that positivism did not explain the actual interactions and strategies of the human participants in science .
As Thomas Kuhn put it , the history of science may be seen in more nuanced terms , such as that of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix that includes intellectual , cultural , economic and political themes outside of science .
Further studies , e.g. Jerome Ravetz 1971 Scientific Knowledge and its Social Problems referred to the role of the scientific community , as a social construct , in accepting or rejecting ( objective ) scientific knowledge .
The Science wars of the 1990 were about the influence of especially French philosophers , which denied the objectivity of science in general or seemed to do so .

The teachings on the Four Noble Truths are regarded as central to the teachings of Buddhism , and are said to provide a conceptual framework for Buddhist thought .
These four truths explain the nature of dukkha ( suffering , anxiety , unsatisfactoriness ) , its causes , and how it can be overcome .

The concept of liberation ( --OOV-- goal of the Buddhist path — is closely related to overcoming ignorance ( --OOV-- ) , a fundamental misunderstanding or mis - perception of the nature of reality .
In awakening to the true nature of the self and all phenomena one develops dispassion for the objects of clinging , and is liberated from suffering ( dukkha ) and the cycle of incessant rebirths ( saṃsāra ) .

To this end , the Buddha recommended viewing things as characterized by the three marks of existence .
Impermanence ( Pāli : anicca ) expresses the Buddhist notion that all compounded or conditioned phenomena ( all things and experiences ) are inconstant , unsteady , and impermanent .
According to the doctrine of impermanence , life embodies this flux in the aging process , the cycle of rebirth ( saṃsāra ) , and in any experience of loss .
The doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent , attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering ( dukkha ) .
Everything we can experience through our senses is made up of parts , and its existence is dependent on external conditions .
Things are constantly coming into being , and ceasing to be .

The doctrine asserts that because things are impermanent , attachment to them is futile and leads to suffering ( dukkha ) .
The word roughly corresponds to a number of terms in English including suffering , pain , unsatisfactoriness , sorrow , affliction , anxiety , dissatisfaction , discomfort , anguish , stress , misery , and frustration .
Although the term is often translated as " suffering " , its philosophical meaning is more analogous to " disquietude " as in the condition of being disturbed .
As such , " suffering " is too narrow a translation with " negative emotional --OOV-- 9 ] that can give the impression that the Buddhist view is pessimistic , but Buddhism seeks to be neither pessimistic nor optimistic , but realistic .
Suffering ( Pāli : --OOV-- dukkha ; Sanskrit --OOV-- --OOV-- ) is also a central concept in Buddhism .

Suffering ( Pāli : --OOV-- dukkha ; Sanskrit --OOV-- --OOV-- ) is also a central concept in Buddhism .
Not - self ( Pāli : anatta ; Sanskrit : --OOV-- ) is the third mark of existence .
In the Nikayas anatta is not meant as a metaphysical assertion , but as an approach for gaining release from suffering .
In fact , the Buddha rejected both of the metaphysical assertions " I have a Self " and " I have no Self " as ontological views that bind one to --OOV-- 9 ] When asked if the self was identical with the body , the Buddha refused to answer .
By analyzing the constantly changing physical and mental constituents ( skandhas ) of a person or object , the practitioner comes to the conclusion that neither the respective parts nor the person as a whole comprise a self .

For Nagarjuna , it is not merely sentient beings that are empty of ātman ; all phenomena ( dharmas ) are without any svabhava ( literally " own - nature " or " self - nature " ) , and thus without any underlying essence ; they are " empty " of being independent ; thus the heterodox theories of svabhava circulating at the time were refuted on the basis of the doctrines of early Buddhism .

Nirvana ( Sanskrit ; Pali : " Nibbāna " ) means " cessation " , " extinction " ( of craving and ignorance and therefore suffering and the cycle of involuntary rebirths ( saṃsāra ) ) , " extinguished " , " quieted " , " calmed " ; it is also known as " Awakening " or " Enlightenment " in the West .

Bodhi ( Pāli and Sanskrit , in devanagari : --OOV-- ) is a term applied to the experience of Awakening of arahants .
In Early Buddhism , bodhi carried a meaning synonymous to nirvana , using only some different metaphors to describe the experience , which implies the extinction of raga ( greed , --OOV-- 12 ] dosa ( hate , --OOV-- 13 ] and moha ( --OOV-- 14 ] In the later school of Mahayana Buddhism , the status of nirvana was downgraded in some scriptures , coming to refer only to the extinction of greed and hate , implying that delusion was still present in one who attained nirvana , and that one needed to attain bodhi to eradicate delusion :

Therefore , according to Mahayana Buddhism , the arahant has attained only nirvana , thus still being subject to delusion , while the bodhisattva not only achieves nirvana but full liberation from delusion as well .
He thus attains bodhi and becomes a buddha .

The term parinirvana is also encountered in Buddhism , and this generally refers to the complete nirvana attained by the arahant at the moment of death , when the physical body expires .
According to Buddhist traditions a Buddha is a fully awakened being who has completely purified his mind of the three poisons of desire , aversion and ignorance .
A Buddha is no longer bound by Samsara and has ended the suffering which unawakened people experience in life .

A common Theravada and Mahayana Buddhist belief is that the next Buddha will be one named Maitreya ( Pali : Metteyya ) .

Bodhi and nirvana carry the same meaning , that of being freed from craving , hate , and delusion .
As a further distinction , the extinction of only hatred and greed ( in the sensory context ) with some residue of delusion , is called --OOV-- .

A Theravada commentary says that Buddhas arise one at a time in this world element , and not at all in others .
Pure Land Buddhism holds that it has declined to the point where few are capable of following the path , so it may be best to rely on the power of Amitābha .
Bodhisattva means " enlightenment being " , and generally refers to one who is on the path to buddhahood .
Traditionally , a bodhisattva is anyone who , motivated by great compassion , has generated bodhicitta , which is a spontaneous wish to attain Buddhahood for the benefit of all sentient beings .

Devotion is an important part of the practice of most Buddhists .
Devotional practices include bowing , offerings , pilgrimage , and chanting .
Buddhism traditionally incorporates states of meditative absorption ( Pali : jhāna ; Skt : dhyāna ) .
The most ancient sustained expression of yogic ideas is found in the early sermons of the Buddha .
The difference between the Buddha 's teaching and the yoga presented in early Brahminic texts is striking .
One key innovative teaching of the Buddha was that meditative absorption must be combined with liberating cognition .
Meditation was an aspect of the practice of the yogis in the centuries preceding the Buddha .
In Buddhism , mindfulness and clear awareness are to be developed at all times ; in pre - Buddhist yogic practices there is no such injunction .
Religious knowledge or " vision " was indicated as a result of practice both within and outside of the Buddhist fold .
Some of the Buddha 's meditative techniques were shared with other traditions of his day , but the idea that ethics are causally related to the attainment of " transcendent wisdom " ( Pali paññā ; Skt .

Two Upanishads written after the rise of Buddhism do contain full - fledged descriptions of yoga as a means to liberation .
While there is no convincing evidence for meditation in pre - Buddhist early Brahminic texts , Wynne argues that formless meditation originated in the Brahminic or --OOV-- tradition , based on strong parallels between Upanishadic cosmological statements and the meditative goals of the two teachers of the Buddha as recorded in the early Buddhist texts .
Having argued that the cosmological statements in the Upanishads also reflect a contemplative tradition , he argues that the --OOV-- Sukta contains evidence for a contemplative tradition , even as early as the late Rig Vedic period .

The practice of taking refuge on behalf of young or even unborn children is mentioned in the Majjhima Nikaya , recognized by most scholars as an early text ( cf .
Tibetan Buddhism sometimes adds a fourth refuge , in the lama .
Just as real jewels never change their faculty and goodness , whether praised or reviled , so are the Three Jewels ( Refuges ) , because they have an eternal and immutable essence . These Three Jewels bring a fruition that is changeless , for once one has reached Buddhahood , there is no possibility of falling back to suffering .
In Mahayana , too , the Three Jewels are perceived as possessed of an eternal and unchanging essence and as having an irreversible effect : " The Three Jewels have the quality of excellence .
According to the scriptures , Gautama Buddha presented himself as a model .
The Dharma offers a refuge by providing guidelines for the alleviation of suffering and the attainment of Nirvana .
The Sangha is considered to provide a refuge by preserving the authentic teachings of the Buddha and providing further examples that the truth of the Buddha 's teachings is attainable .
--OOV-- ( Sanskrit ) or sīla ( Pāli ) is usually translated into English as " virtuous behavior " , " morality " , " moral discipline " , " ethics " or " precept " .
It is one of the three practices ( sīla , samādhi , and paññā ) and the second --OOV-- .
According to the Law of Karma , keeping the precepts is meritorious and it acts as causes that would bring about peaceful and happy effects .
--OOV-- is the foundation of Samādhi / --OOV-- ( Meditative cultivation ) or mind cultivation .
According to the Law of Karma , keeping the precepts is meritorious and it acts as causes that would bring about peaceful and happy effects .
--OOV-- refers to overall principles of ethical behavior .
There are several levels of sīla , which correspond to " basic morality " ( five precepts ) , " basic morality with asceticism " ( eight precepts ) , " novice monkhood " ( ten precepts ) and " monkhood " ( Vinaya or Patimokkha ) .
If they wish , they can choose to undertake the eight precepts , which add basic asceticism .
The precepts are not formulated as imperatives , but as training rules that laypeople undertake voluntarily to facilitate practice .
In Buddhist thought , the cultivation of dana and ethical conduct themselves refine consciousness to such a level that rebirth in one of the lower heavens is likely , even if there is no further Buddhist practice .

The complete list of ten precepts may be observed by laypeople for short periods .
For the complete list , the seventh precept is partitioned into two , and a tenth added :
Novice - monks use the ten precepts , which are the basic precepts for monastics .
The precise content of the --OOV-- ( scriptures on Vinaya ) differs slightly according to different schools , and different schools or --OOV-- set different standards for the degree of adherence to Vinaya .

Regarding the monastic rules , the Buddha constantly reminds his hearers that it is the spirit that counts .
On the other hand , the rules themselves are designed to assure a satisfying life , and provide a perfect springboard for the higher attainments .

Monastics are instructed by the Buddha to live as " islands unto themselves " .
In Eastern Buddhism , there is also a distinctive Vinaya and ethics contained within the Mahayana --OOV-- Sutra ( not to be confused with the Pali text of that name ) for Bodhisattvas , where , for example , the eating of meat is frowned upon and vegetarianism is actively encouraged ( see vegetarianism in Buddhism ) .

In Japan , this has almost completely displaced the monastic vinaya , and allows clergy to marry .
In Chinese Buddhism , these exist ( translated chih kuan ) , but Chán ( Zen ) meditation is more popular .
The evidence of the early texts suggests that at the time of the Buddha , many male and female lay practitioners did practice meditation , some even to the point of proficiency in all eight jhānas ( see the next section regarding --OOV-- 11 ]

Upon development of samādhi , one 's mind becomes purified of defilement , calm , tranquil , and luminous .
Once the meditator achieves a strong and powerful concentration ( jhāna , Sanskrit --OOV-- dhyāna ) , his mind is ready to penetrate and gain insight ( vipassanā ) into the ultimate nature of reality , eventually obtaining release from all suffering .

Initially , --OOV-- is attained at a conceptual level by means of listening to sermons ( dharma talks ) , reading , studying , and sometimes reciting Buddhist texts and engaging in discourse .
Notably , one could in theory attain Nirvana at any point of practice , whether deep in meditation , listening to a sermon , conducting the business of one 's daily life , or any other activity .
Once the conceptual understanding is attained , it is applied to daily life so that each Buddhist can verify the truth of the Buddha 's teaching at a practical level .

Zen Buddhism is divided into two main schools : Rinzai ( --OOV-- ) and Sōtō ( --OOV-- ) , the former greatly favouring the use in meditation on the koan ( --OOV-- , a meditative riddle or puzzle ) as a device for spiritual break - through , and the latter ( while certainly employing koans ) focusing more on shikantaza or " just --OOV-- 13 ]

Zen Buddhist teaching is often full of paradox , in order to loosen the grip of the ego and to facilitate the penetration into the realm of the True Self or Formless Self , which is equated with the Buddha --OOV-- 14 ] According to Zen master Kosho Uchiyama , when thoughts and fixation on the little " I " are transcended , an Awakening to a universal , non - dual Self occurs : " When we let go of thoughts and wake up to the reality of life that is working beyond them , we discover the Self that is living universal non - dual life ( before the separation into two ) that pervades all living creatures and all existence .

Historically , the roots of Buddhism lie in the religious thought of ancient India during the second half of the first millennium BCE .

Other Vedic texts reveal a dislike of the people of Magadha , in all probability because the --OOV-- at this time were not --OOV-- needed ] It was not until the 2nd or 3rd centuries BCE that the eastward spread of Brahmanism into Greater Magadha became significant .
At the same time , these movements were influenced by , and in some respects continued , philosophical thought within the Vedic tradition as reflected e.g. in the Upanishads .
These movements included , besides Buddhism , various skeptics ( such as Sanjaya --OOV-- ) , atomists ( such as --OOV-- --OOV-- ) , materialists ( such as Ajita --OOV-- ) , antinomians ( such as Purana Kassapa ) ; the most important ones in the 5th century BCE were the --OOV-- , who emphasized the rule of fate , the --OOV-- ( materialists ) , the --OOV-- ( agnostics ) and the Jains , who stressed that the soul must be freed from matter .

A core problem in the study of early Buddhism is the relation between dhyana and insight .
--OOV-- , in his often - cited article On some Aspects of Descriptions or Theories of ' Liberating Insight ' and ' Enlightenment ' in Early Buddhism notes that the mention of the four noble truths as constituting " liberating insight " , which is attained after mastering the Rupa Jhanas , is a later addition to texts such as Majjhima Nikaya --OOV-- needed ]

According to Vetter , the description of the Buddhist path may initially have been as simple as the term " the middle way " .
In time , this short description was elaborated , resulting in the description of the eightfold path .
According to both Bronkhorst and Anderson , the four truths became a substitution for prajna , or " liberating insight " , in the suttas in those texts where " liberating insight " was preceded by the four jhanas .

Pre - sectarian Buddhism is the earliest phase of Buddhism , recognized by nearly all scholars .
Certain basic teachings appear in many places throughout the early texts , so most scholars conclude that Gautama Buddha must have taught something similar to the Three marks of existence , the Five Aggregates , dependent origination , karma and rebirth , the Four Noble Truths , the Noble Eightfold Path , and nirvana .

According to the scriptures , soon after the --OOV-- ( from Sanskrit : " highest extinguishment " ) of Gautama Buddha , the first Buddhist council was held .

According to the Dipavamsa of the Pāli tradition , they started immediately after the Second Council , the --OOV-- tradition places it in 137 AN , the Sarvastivada tradition of --OOV-- says it was in the time of Ashoka and the Mahasanghika tradition places it much later , nearly 100 BCE .
This contradicts the --OOV-- ' own vinaya , which shows them as on the same , winning side .
The Dipavamsa of the Theravāda says that the losing party in the Second Council dispute broke away in protest and formed the Mahasanghika .
The --OOV-- argued that the --OOV-- were trying to expand the vinaya and may also have challenged what they perceived were excessive claims or inhumanly high criteria for --OOV-- .
The --OOV-- gave rise to several schools , one of which was the Theravāda school .
Originally , these schisms were caused by disputes over vinaya , and monks following different schools of thought seem to have lived happily together in the same monasteries , but eventually , by about 100 CE if not earlier , schisms were being caused by doctrinal disagreements too .

Following ( or leading up to ) the schisms , each --OOV-- started to accumulate an Abhidharma , a detailed scholastic reworking of doctrinal material appearing in the Suttas , according to schematic classifications .
These Abhidharma texts do not contain systematic philosophical treatises , but summaries or numerical lists .
Scholars generally date these texts to around the 3rd century BCE , 100 to 200 years after the death of the Buddha .
Scholars disagree on whether the Mahasanghika school had an Abhidhamma Pitaka or --OOV-- 38 ]

There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism , but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals , and later doctrines , for bodhisattvas .
Paul Williams has also noted that the Mahāyāna never had nor ever attempted to have a separate Vinaya or ordination lineage from the early schools of Buddhism , and therefore each --OOV-- or --OOV-- adhering to the Mahāyāna formally belonged to an early school .
From Chinese monks visiting India , we now know that both Mahāyāna and non - Mahāyāna monks in India often lived in the same monasteries side by side .
Much of the early extant evidence for the origins of Mahāyāna comes from early Chinese translations of Mahāyāna texts .

Buddhism may have spread only slowly in India until the time of the Mauryan emperor Ashoka , who was a public supporter of the religion .

The Silk Road transmission of Buddhism to China is most commonly thought to have started in the late 2nd or the 1st century CE , though the literary sources are all open to --OOV-- 41 ] The first documented translation efforts by foreign Buddhist monks in China were in the 2nd century CE , probably as a consequence of the expansion of the Kushan Empire into the Chinese territory of the Tarim Basin .

Formal membership varies between communities , but basic lay adherence is often defined in terms of a traditional formula in which the practitioner takes refuge in The Three Jewels : the Buddha , the Dharma ( the teachings of the Buddha ) , and the Sangha ( the Buddhist community ) .

While in the West Buddhism is often seen as exotic and progressive , in the East it is regarded as familiar and traditional .
Modern influences increasingly lead to new forms of Buddhism that significantly depart from traditional beliefs and practices .
A number of modern movements or tendencies in Buddhism emerged during the second half of the 20th Century , including the Dalit Buddhist movement ( also sometimes called ' neo - Buddhism ' ) , Engaged Buddhism , and the further development of various Western Buddhist traditions .

Hinayana ( literally " lesser vehicle " ) is used by Mahayana followers to name the family of early philosophical schools and traditions from which contemporary Theravada emerged , but as this term is rooted in the Mahayana viewpoint and can be considered derogatory , a variety of other terms are increasingly used instead , including --OOV-- , Nikaya Buddhism , early Buddhist schools , sectarian Buddhism , conservative Buddhism , mainstream Buddhism and non - Mahayana Buddhism .

Not all traditions of Buddhism share the same philosophical outlook , or treat the same concepts as central .
For example , according to one Buddhist ecumenical --OOV-- 23 ] several concepts common to both major Buddhist branches :
Theravada ( " Doctrine of the Elders " , or " Ancient Doctrine " ) is the oldest surviving Buddhist school .
The name Theravāda comes from the ancestral --OOV-- , one of the early Buddhist schools , from which the Theravadins claim descent .
Sinhalese Buddhist reformers in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries portrayed the Pali Canon as the original version of scripture .
It has a growing presence in the west .
Theravadin Buddhists believe that personal effort is required to realize rebirth .
Laypersons can perform good actions , producing merit .
Mahāyāna centres of learning were established , the most important one being the --OOV-- University in north - eastern India .
Mahayana schools recognize all or part of the Mahayana Sutras .
Some of these sutras became for Mahayanists a manifestation of the Buddha himself , and faith in and veneration of those texts are stated in some sutras ( e.g. the Lotus Sutra and the Mahaparinirvana Sutra ) to lay the foundations for the later attainment of Buddhahood itself .

Native Mahayana Buddhism is practiced today in China , Japan , Korea , Singapore , parts of Russia and most of Vietnam ( also commonly referred to as " Eastern Buddhism " ) .
The Buddhism practiced in Tibet , the Himalayan regions , and Mongolia is also Mahayana in origin , but is discussed below under the heading of Vajrayana ( also commonly referred to as " Northern Buddhism " ) .
There are a variety of strands in Eastern Buddhism , of which " the Pure Land school of Mahayana is the most widely practised today .
Various classes of Vajrayana literature developed as a result of royal courts sponsoring both Buddhism and Saivism .
The --OOV-- , which later came to classified under --OOV-- , states that mantras taught in the Saiva , Garuda and Vaisnava tantras will be effective if applied by Buddhists since they were all taught originally by Manjushri .
The --OOV-- of --OOV-- , a work associated with the Guhyasamaja tradition , prescribes acting as a Saiva guru and initiating members into Saiva Siddhanta scriptures and mandalas .
Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety .
Some schools venerate certain texts as religious objects in themselves , while others take a more scholastic approach .
Unlike many religions , Buddhism has no single central text that is universally referred to by all traditions .
The Tibetan Buddhists have not even translated most of the --OOV-- ( though theoretically they recognize them ) and they play no part in the religious life of either clergy or laity in China and Japan .
However , some scholars have referred to the Vinaya Pitaka and the first four Nikayas of the Sutta Pitaka as the common core of all Buddhist --OOV-- needed ] This could be considered misleading , as Mahāyāna considers these merely a preliminary , and not a core , teaching .
The size and complexity of the Buddhist canons have been seen by some ( including Buddhist social reformer Babasaheb Ambedkar ) as presenting barriers to the wider understanding of Buddhist philosophy .
Later in Sri Lanka , the Dhammapada was championed as a unifying scripture .
Over the years , various attempts have been made to synthesize a single Buddhist text that can encompass all of the major principles of Buddhism .
In the Theravada tradition , condensed ' study texts ' were created that combined popular or influential scriptures into single volumes that could be studied by novice monks .
Dwight Goddard collected a sample of Buddhist scriptures , with the emphasis on Zen , along with other classics of Eastern philosophy , such as the Tao Te Ching , into his ' Buddhist Bible ' in the 1920s .
More recently , Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar attempted to create a single , combined document of Buddhist principles in " The Buddha and His Dhamma " .
The Pāli Tipitaka , which means " three baskets " , refers to the Vinaya Pitaka , the Sutta Pitaka , and the Abhidhamma Pitaka .

The Pāli Tipitaka is the only early Tipitaka ( Sanskrit : --OOV-- ) to survive intact in its original language , but a number of early schools had their own recensions of the Tipitaka featuring much of the same material .
According to some sources , some early schools of Buddhism had five or seven --OOV-- .
According to the scriptures , soon after the death of the Buddha , the first Buddhist council was held ; a monk named --OOV-- ( Pāli : --OOV-- ) presided .
The goal of the council was to record the Buddha 's teachings .
--OOV-- recited the vinaya .

Much of the material in the Canon is not specifically " Theravadin " , but is instead the collection of teachings that this school preserved from the early , non - sectarian body of teachings .
He states : " The Theravadins , then , may have added texts to the Canon for some time , but they do not appear to have tampered with what they already had from an earlier period .

Some adherents of Mahayana accept both the early teachings ( including in this the Sarvastivada Abhidharma , which was criticized by Nagarjuna and is in fact opposed to early Buddhist thought ) and the Mahayana sutras as authentic teachings of Gautama Buddha , and claim they were designed for different types of persons and different levels of spiritual understanding .

Approximately six hundred Mahayana sutras have survived in Sanskrit or in Chinese or Tibetan translations .
In addition , East Asian Buddhism recognizes some sutras regarded by scholars as of Chinese rather than Indian origin .
It was not until after the 5th century CE that the Mahayana sutras started to influence the behavior of mainstream Buddhists in India : " But outside of texts , at least in India , at exactly the same period , very different — in fact seemingly older — ideas and aspirations appear to be motivating actual behavior , and old and established --OOV-- groups appear to be the only ones that are patronized and supported .
" These texts were apparently not universally accepted among Indian Buddhists when they appeared ; the pejorative label Hinayana was applied by Mahayana supporters to those who rejected the Mahayana sutras .
Only the Theravada school does not include the Mahayana scriptures in its canon .
As the modern Theravada school is descended from a branch of Buddhism that diverged and established itself in Sri Lanka prior to the emergence of the Mahayana texts , debate exists as to whether the Theravada were historically included in the hinayana designation ; in the modern era , this label is seen as derogatory , and is generally avoided .

Jonathan Silk has argued that the term " Hinayana " was used to refer to whomever one wanted to criticize on any given occasion , and did not refer to any definite grouping of Buddhists .
" She notes that the term --OOV-- was " the more politically correct and much more usual " term used by --OOV-- .
Buddhism provides many opportunities for comparative study with a diverse range of subjects .
For example , Buddhism 's emphasis on the Middle way not only provides a unique guideline for ethics but has also allowed Buddhism to peacefully coexist with various differing beliefs , customs and institutions in countries where it has resided throughout its history .
Also , its moral and spiritual parallels with other systems of thought — for example , with various tenets of Christianity — have been subjects of close study .

Literature consists of written productions , often restricted to those deemed to have artistic or intellectual value .
Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non - fiction and whether it is poetry or prose ; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel , short story or drama ; and works are often categorised according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations ( genre ) .

Its Latin root literatura / --OOV-- ( derived itself from littera , letter or handwriting ) was used to refer to all written accounts , but intertwined with the roman concept of cultura : learning or cultivation .
Definitions of literature have varied over time ; it is a " culturally relative definition " .
In Western Europe prior to the eighteenth century , literature as a term indicated all books and writing .
A more restricted sense of the term emerged during the Romantic period , in which it began to demarcate " imaginative " literature .

This is the definition used in the Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition ( --OOV-- ) when it classifies literature as " the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing . " However , this has the result that there is no objective definition of what constitutes " literature " ; anything can be literature , and anything which is universally regarded as literature has the potential to be excluded , since value - judgements can change over time .

The formalist definition is that the history of " literature " foregrounds poetic effects ; it is the " literariness " or " --OOV-- " of literature that distinguishes it from ordinary speech or other kinds of writing ( e.g. , journalism ) .

The problem with the formalist definition is that in order to say that literature deviates from ordinary uses of language , those uses must first be identified ; this is difficult because " ordinary language " is an unstable category , differing according to social categories and across history .

Jim Meyer considers this a useful characteristic in explaining the use of the term to mean published material in a particular field ( e.g. , " scientific literature " ) , as such writing must use language according to particular standards .
Poetry is a form of literary art which uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings in addition to , or in place of , prosaic ostensible meaning .
Poetry has traditionally been distinguished from prose by its being set in --OOV-- ] prose is cast in sentences , poetry in lines ; the syntax of prose is dictated by meaning , whereas that of poetry is held across metre or the visual aspects of the poem .

Drama is literature intended for performance .

Studying and analyzing literature becomes very important in terms of learning about our history .
Authors often include historical moments in their works , like when Lord Byron talks about the Spanish and the French in ‘ ‘ Childe Harold ’s Pilgrimage : Canto I ’’ and expresses his opinions through his character Childe Harold .
Information became easier to pass down from generation to generation once we began to write it down .
This can even help us to understand references made in more modern literature because authors often make references to Greek mythology and other old religious texts or historical moments .
As a more urban culture developed , academies provided a means of transmission for speculative and philosophical literature in early civilizations , resulting in the prevalence of literature in Ancient China , Ancient India , Persia and Ancient Greece and Rome .
Many works of earlier periods , even in narrative form , had a covert moral or didactic purpose , such as the Sanskrit Panchatantra or the Metamorphoses of Ovid .
Drama and satire also developed as urban culture provided a larger public audience , and later readership , for literary production .
Lyric poetry ( as opposed to epic poetry ) was often the speciality of courts and aristocratic circles , particularly in East Asia where songs were collected by the Chinese aristocracy as poems , the most notable being the Shijing or Book of Songs .

In ancient China , early literature was primarily focused on philosophy , historiography , military science , agriculture , and poetry .
China , the origin of modern paper making and woodblock printing , produced one of the world 's first print cultures .
Much of Chinese literature originates with the Hundred Schools of Thought period that occurred during the Eastern Zhou Dynasty ( 769 - 269 BCE ) .
The most important of these include the Classics of Confucianism , of Daoism , of Mohism , of Legalism , as well as works of military science ( e.g. Sun Tzu 's The Art of War ) and Chinese history ( e.g. Sima Qian 's Records of the Grand Historian ) .

Sanskrit literature begins with the Vedas , dating back to --OOV-- BCE , and continues with the Sanskrit Epics of Iron Age India .
The Vedas are among the oldest sacred texts .
The Samhitas ( vedic collections ) date to roughly --OOV-- BCE , and the " circum - Vedic " texts , as well as the redaction of the Samhitas , date to c. 1000 - 500 BCE , resulting in a Vedic period , spanning the mid 2nd to mid 1st millennium BCE , or the Late Bronze Age and the Iron Age .

The inevitable reaction was the explosion of Romanticism in the later 18th century which reclaimed the imaginative and fantastical bias of old romances and folk - literature and asserted the primacy of individual experience and emotion .
But as the 19th - century went on , European fiction evolved towards realism and naturalism , the meticulous documentation of real life and social trends .

As advances and specialization have made new scientific research inaccessible to most audiences , the " literary " nature of science writing has become less pronounced over the last two centuries .
Now , science appears mostly in journals .
Scientific works of Aristotle , Copernicus , and Newton still exhibit great value , but since the science in them has largely become outdated , they no longer serve for scientific instruction .
Outside of " history of science " programmes , students rarely read such works .
Philosophy has become an increasingly academic discipline .
More of its practitioners lament this situation than occurs with the sciences ; nonetheless most new philosophical work appears in academic journals .
Major philosophers through history — Plato , Aristotle , Socrates , Augustine , Descartes , Kierkegaard , Nietzsche — have become as canonical as any writers .
Some recent philosophy works are argued to merit the title " literature " , but much of it does not , and some areas , such as logic , have become extremely technical to a degree similar to that of mathematics .

Literature allows readers to access intimate emotional aspects of a person ’s character that would not be obvious otherwise .
It benefits the psychological development and understanding of the reader .

This can be understood in the sense that literature unites a large community by provoking universal emotions .
It also allows readers to access cultural aspects that they are not exposed to thus provoking new emotional experiences .
Authors choose literary device according to what psychological emotion he or she is attempting to describe , thus certain literary devices are more emotionally effective than others .

Maslow ’s ‘ ‘ Third Force Psychology Theory ’’ even allows literary analysts to critically understand how characters reflect the culture and the history in which they are contextualized .
The theory suggests that human beings possess a nature within them that demonstrates their true “ self ” and it suggests that the fulfillment of this nature is the reason for living .

Many asset managers chose to continue to invest client funds in over - priced ( under - yielding ) investments , to the detriment of their clients , in order to maintain their assets under management .
Moreover , a conflict of interest between professional investment managers and their institutional clients , combined with a global glut in investment capital , led to bad investments by asset managers in over - priced credit assets .
Professional investment managers generally are compensated based on the volume of client assets under management .
There is , therefore , an incentive for asset managers to expand their assets under management in order to maximize their compensation .
This choice was supported by a " plausible deniability " of the risks associated with subprime - based credit assets because the loss experience with early " vintages " of subprime loans was so low .

IndyMac warned that if its regulators found its capital position to have fallen below " well capitalized " ( minimum 10 % risk - based capital ratio ) to " adequately capitalized " ( --OOV-- % risk - based capital ratio ) the bank might no longer be able to use brokered deposits as a source of funds .
Senator Charles Schumer ( D - NY ) would later point out that brokered deposits made up more than 37 percent of IndyMac 's total deposits and ask the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) whether it had considered ordering IndyMac to reduce its reliance on these deposits .

With $ 18.9 billion in total deposits reported on March 31 , Senator Schumer would have been referring to a little over $ 7 billion in brokered deposits .
While the breakout of maturities of these deposits is not known exactly , a simple averaging would have put the threat of brokered deposits loss to IndyMac at $ 500 million a month , had the regulator disallowed IndyMac from acquiring new brokered deposits on June 30 .

When home prices declined in the latter half of 2007 and the secondary mortgage market collapsed , IndyMac was forced to hold $ 10.7 billion of loans it could not sell in the secondary market .
This “ run ” on the thrift followed the public release of a letter from Senator Charles Schumer to the FDIC and OTS .
While the run was a contributing factor in the timing of IndyMac ’s demise , the underlying cause of the failure was the unsafe and unsound manner in which the thrift was operated .
A bridge bank , IndyMac Federal Bank , FSB , was established to assume control of IndyMac Bank 's assets , its secured liabilities , and its insured deposit accounts .
The FDIC guarantees the funds of all insured accounts up to US$ 100,000 , and has declared a special advance dividend to the roughly 10,000 depositors with funds in excess of the insured amount , guaranteeing 50 % of any amounts in excess of $ 100,000 .

Without the ability to obtain investor funds in exchange for most types of mortgage - backed securities or asset - backed commercial paper , investment banks and other entities in the shadow banking system could not provide funds to mortgage firms and other corporations .
Economist Paul Krugman and U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner explain the credit crisis via the implosion of the shadow banking system , which had grown to nearly equal the importance of the traditional commercial banking sector as described above .
This meant that nearly one - third of the U.S. lending mechanism was frozen and continued to be frozen into June 2009 .
While traditional banks have raised their lending standards , it was the collapse of the shadow banking system that is the primary cause of the reduction in funds available for borrowing .
According to the Brookings Institution , the traditional banking system does not have the capital to close this gap as of June 2009 : " It would take a number of years of strong profits to generate sufficient capital to support that additional lending volume " .
The authors also indicate that some forms of securitization are " likely to vanish forever , having been an artifact of excessively loose credit conditions " .

On the other hand , a homeowner who has no equity is a serious default risk .
The problem with the economy is the loss of close to $ 6 trillion in housing wealth and an even larger amount of stock wealth .
Tens of millions of homeowners who had substantial equity in their homes two years ago have little or nothing today .
In the case of businesses , their creditworthiness depends on their future profits .
Profit prospects look much worse in November 2008 than they did in November 2007 ... While many banks are obviously at the brink , consumers and businesses would be facing a much harder time getting credit right now even if the financial system were rock solid .
The continuing development of the crisis has prompted fears of a global economic collapse although there are now many cautiously optimistic forecasters in addition to some prominent sources who remain negative .
Investment bank UBS stated on October 6 that 2008 would see a clear global recession , with recovery unlikely for at least two years .
UBS quantified their expected recession durations on October 16 : the Eurozone 's would last two quarters , the United States ' would last three quarters , and the United Kingdom 's would last four quarters .
Relative to the size of its economy , Iceland ’s banking collapse is the largest suffered by any country in economic history .
Three days later UBS economists announced that the " beginning of the end " of the crisis had begun , with the world starting to make the necessary actions to fix the crisis : capital injection by governments ; injection made systemically ; interest rate cuts to help borrowers .
The Brookings Institution reported in June 2009 that U.S. consumption accounted for more than a third of the growth in global consumption between 2000 and 2007 .
For the first quarter of 2009 , the annualized rate of decline in GDP was 14.4 % in Germany , 15.2 % in Japan , 7.4 % in the UK , 18 % in Latvia , 9.8 % in the Euro area and 21.5 % for Mexico .

" The US economy has been spending too much and borrowing too much for years and the rest of the world depended on the U.S. consumer as a source of global demand .
" With a recession in the U.S. and the increased savings rate of U.S. consumers , declines in growth elsewhere have been dramatic .
For example , growth forecasts in Cambodia show a fall from more than 10 % in 2007 to close to zero in 2009 , and Kenya may achieve only --OOV-- % growth in 2009 , down from 7 % in 2007 .
According to the research by the Overseas Development Institute , reductions in growth can be attributed to falls in trade , commodity prices , investment and remittances sent from migrant workers ( which reached a record $ 251 billion in 2007 , but have fallen in many countries since ) .
This has stark implications and has led to a dramatic rise in the number of households living below the poverty line , be it 300,000 in Bangladesh or 230,000 in Ghana .

The World Bank reported in February 2009 that the Arab World was far less severely affected by the credit crunch .
With generally good balance of payments positions coming into the crisis or with alternative sources of financing for their large current account deficits , such as remittances , Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) or foreign aid , Arab countries were able to avoid going to the market in the latter part of 2008 .
This gives them a significant cushion against the global downturn .
The greatest impact of the global economic crisis will come in the form of lower oil prices , which remains the single most important determinant of economic performance .
Steadily declining oil prices would force them to draw down reserves and cut down on investments .
The U.S. unemployment rate increased to 10.1 % by October 2009 , the highest rate since 1983 and roughly twice the pre - crisis rate .

Critics argue that Basel III does n’t address the problem of faulty risk - weightings .
Major banks suffered losses from AAA - rated created by financial engineering ( which creates apparently risk - free assets out of high risk collateral ) that required less capital according to Basel II .
European regulators introduced Basel III regulations for banks .
Johan Norberg argues that regulations ( Basel III among others ) have indeed led to excessive lending to risky governments ( see European sovereign - debt crisis ) and the ECB pursues even more lending as the solution .
It increased capital ratios , limits on leverage , narrow definition of capital ( to exclude subordinated debt ) , limit counter - party risk , and new liquidity requirements .
The U.S. recession that began in December 2007 ended in June 2009 , according to the U.S. National Bureau of Economic Research ( NBER ) and the financial crisis appears to have ended about the same time .

Krugman 's contention ( that the growth of a commercial real estate bubble indicates that U.S. housing policy was not the cause of the crisis ) is challenged by additional analysis .
After researching the default of commercial loans during the financial crisis , Xudong An and Anthony B. Sanders reported ( in December 2010 ) : " We find limited evidence that substantial deterioration in CMBS [ commercial mortgage - backed securities ] loan underwriting occurred prior to the crisis .
Business journalist Kimberly Amadeo reports : " The first signs of decline in residential real estate occurred in 2006 .

Investment banks on Wall Street answered this demand with products such as the mortgage - backed security and the collateralized debt obligation that were assigned safe ratings by the credit rating agencies .
In a Peabody Award winning program , NPR correspondents argued that a " Giant Pool of Money " ( represented by $ 70 trillion in worldwide fixed income investments ) sought higher yields than those offered by U.S. Treasury bonds early in the decade .
This pool of money had roughly doubled in size from 2000 to 2007 , yet the supply of relatively safe , income generating investments had not grown as fast .

The collateralized debt obligation in particular enabled financial institutions to obtain investor funds to finance subprime and other lending , extending or increasing the housing bubble and generating large fees .

Those securities first in line received investment - grade ratings from rating agencies .
This essentially places cash payments from multiple mortgages or other debt obligations into a single pool from which specific securities draw in a specific sequence of priority .
Securities with lower priority had lower credit ratings but theoretically a higher rate of return on the amount invested .

During 2007 , lenders began foreclosure proceedings on nearly 1.3 million properties , a 79 % increase over 2006 .
This increased to 2.3 million in 2008 , an 81 % increase vs. 2007 .
By September 2009 , this had risen to 14.4 % .
From 2000 to 2003 , the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate target from 6.5 % to 1.0 % .
This was done to soften the effects of the collapse of the dot - com bubble and the September 2001 terrorist attacks , as well as to combat a perceived risk of deflation .
As early as 2002 it was apparent that credit was fueling housing instead of business investment as some economists went so far as to advocate that the Fed " needs to create a housing bubble to replace the Nasdaq bubble " .
Moreover , empirical studies using data from advanced countries show that excessive credit growth contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis .
Lower interest rates encouraged borrowing .
Bernanke explained that between 1996 and 2004 , the U.S. current account deficit increased by $ 650 billion , from 1.5 % to 5.8 % of GDP .

These were mainly the emerging economies in Asia and oil - exporting nations .
The balance of payments identity requires that a country ( such as the U.S. ) running a current account deficit also have a capital account ( investment ) surplus of the same amount .
Hence large and growing amounts of foreign funds ( capital ) flowed into the U.S. to finance its imports .
The Fed then raised the Fed funds rate significantly between July 2004 and July 2006 .
This contributed to an increase in 1-year and 5-year adjustable - rate mortgage ( ARM ) rates , making ARM interest rate resets more expensive for homeowners .
This may have also contributed to the deflating of the housing bubble , as asset prices generally move inversely to interest rates , and it became riskier to speculate in housing .

U.S. housing and financial assets dramatically declined in value after the housing bubble burst .

Predatory lending refers to the practice of unscrupulous lenders , enticing borrowers to enter into " unsafe " or " unsound " secured loans for inappropriate purposes .
A classic bait - and - switch method was used by Countrywide Financial , advertising low interest rates for home refinancing .
Whereas the advertisement might state that 1 % or 1.5 % interest would be charged , the consumer would be put into an adjustable rate mortgage ( ARM ) in which the interest charged would be greater than the amount of interest paid .
This created negative amortization , which the credit consumer might not notice until long after the loan transaction had been consummated .

When housing prices decreased , homeowners in ARMs then had little incentive to pay their monthly payments , since their home equity had disappeared .
This caused Countrywide 's financial condition to deteriorate , ultimately resulting in a decision by the Office of Thrift Supervision to seize the lender .

Prior to the crisis , financial institutions became highly leveraged , increasing their appetite for risky investments and reducing their resilience in case of losses .
Much of this leverage was achieved using complex financial instruments such as off - balance sheet securitization and derivatives , which made it difficult for creditors and regulators to monitor and try to reduce financial institution risk levels .
These instruments also made it virtually impossible to reorganize financial institutions in bankruptcy , and contributed to the need for government bailouts .

Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and was liquidated , Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch were sold at fire - sale prices , and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley became commercial banks , subjecting themselves to more stringent regulation .
Behavior that may be optimal for an individual ( e.g. , saving more during adverse economic conditions ) can be detrimental if too many individuals pursue the same behavior , as ultimately one person 's consumption is another person 's income .
Too many consumers attempting to save ( or pay down debt ) simultaneously is called the paradox of thrift and can cause or deepen a recession .

The term financial innovation refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives , such as offsetting a particular risk exposure ( such as the default of a borrower ) or to assist with obtaining financing .
Examples pertinent to this crisis included : the adjustable - rate mortgage ; the bundling of subprime mortgages into mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) or collateralized debt obligations ( CDO ) for sale to investors , a type of securitization ; and a form of credit insurance called credit default swaps ( CDS ) .

It multiplied the number of actors connected to a single mortgage ( including mortgage brokers , specialized originators , the securitizers and their due diligence firms , managing agents and trading desks , and finally investors , insurances and providers of repo funding ) .
With increasing distance from the underlying asset these actors relied more and more on indirect information ( including FICO scores on creditworthiness , appraisals and due diligence checks by third party organizations , and most importantly the computer models of rating agencies and risk management desks ) .

Several scholars have argued that a lack of transparency about banks ' risk exposures prevented markets from correctly pricing risk before the crisis , enabled the mortgage market to grow larger than it otherwise would have , and made the financial crisis far more disruptive than it would have been if risk levels had been disclosed in a straightforward , readily understandable format .

However , AIG did not have the financial strength to support its many CDS commitments as the crisis progressed and was taken over by the government in September 2008 .
U.S. taxpayers provided over $ 180 billion in government support to AIG during 2008 and early 2009 , through which the money flowed to various counterparties to CDS transactions , including many large global financial institutions .
The basic CDS transaction involved AIG receiving a premium in exchange for a promise to pay money to party A in the event party B defaulted .
George Soros commented that " The super - boom got out of hand when the new products became so complicated that the authorities could no longer calculate the risks and started relying on the risk management methods of the banks themselves .
As financial assets became more and more complex , and harder and harder to value , investors were reassured by the fact that both the international bond rating agencies and bank regulators , who came to rely on them , accepted as valid some complex mathematical models which theoretically showed the risks were much smaller than they actually proved to be .
Similarly , the rating agencies relied on the information provided by the originators of synthetic products .

Experts debate the causes , with some attributing it to speculative flow of money from housing and other investments into commodities , some to monetary policy , and some to the increasing feeling of raw materials scarcity in a fast - growing world , leading to long positions taken on those markets , such as Chinese increasing presence in Africa .
An increase in oil prices tends to divert a larger share of consumer spending into gasoline , which creates downward pressure on economic growth in oil importing countries , as wealth flows to oil - producing states .

Current Governor of the Reserve Bank of India Raghuram Rajan had predicted the crisis in 2005 when he became chief economist at the International Monetary Fund .
In 2005 , at a celebration honouring Alan Greenspan , who was about to retire as chairman of the US Federal Reserve , Rajan delivered a controversial paper that was critical of the financial sector .
In that paper , " Has Financial Development Made the World Riskier ? " , Rajan " argued that disaster might loom .
These risks are known as tail risks .
The financial crisis was not widely predicted by mainstream economists except Raghuram Rajan , who instead spoke of the Great Moderation .

Dirk Bezemer in his research credits ( with supporting argument and estimates of timing ) 12 economists with predicting the crisis : Dean Baker ( US ) , Wynne Godley ( UK ) , Fred Harrison ( UK ) , Michael Hudson ( US ) , Eric Janszen ( US ) , Steve Keen ( Australia ) , Jakob --OOV-- Madsen & Jens Kjaer Sørensen ( Denmark ) , Kurt --OOV-- ( US ) , Nouriel Roubini ( US ) , Peter Schiff ( US ) , and Robert Shiller ( US ) .
Not surprisingly , the Austrian economic school regarded the crisis as a vindication and classic example of a predictable credit - fueled bubble that could not forestall the disregarded but inevitable effect of an artificial , manufactured laxity in monetary supply , a perspective that even former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan in Congressional testimony confessed himself forced to return to .

A cover story in BusinessWeek magazine claims that economists mostly failed to predict the worst international economic crisis since the Great Depression of the 1930s .
The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania 's online business journal examines why economists failed to predict a major global financial crisis .
For example , an article in the New York Times informs that economist Nouriel Roubini warned of such crisis as early as September 2006 , and the article goes on to state that the profession of economics is bad at predicting recessions .
According to The Guardian , Roubini was ridiculed for predicting a collapse of the housing market and worldwide recession , while The New York Times labelled him " Dr. Doom " .
Stock trader and financial risk engineer Nassim Nicholas Taleb , author of the 2007 book The Black Swan , spent years warning against the breakdown of the banking system in particular and the economy in general owing to their use of bad risk models and reliance on forecasting , and their reliance on bad models , and framed the problem as part of " robustness and fragility " .
According to David Brooks from the New York Times , " Taleb not only has an explanation for what ’s happening , he saw it coming .

He also took action against the establishment view by making a big financial bet on banking stocks and making a fortune from the crisis ( " They did n't listen , so I took their money " ) .
Market strategist Phil Dow believes distinctions exist " between the current market malaise " and the Great Depression .
He says the Dow Jones average 's fall of more than 50 % over a period of 17 months is similar to a 54.7 % fall in the Great Depression , followed by a total drop of 89 % over the following 16 months .

Floyd Norris , the chief financial correspondent of The New York Times , wrote in a blog entry in March 2009 that the decline has not been a mirror image of the Great Depression , explaining that although the decline amounts were nearly the same at the time , the rates of decline had started much faster in 2007 , and that the past year had only ranked eighth among the worst recorded years of percentage drops in the Dow .
One of the first victims was Northern Rock , a medium - sized British bank .
The highly leveraged nature of its business led the bank to request security from the Bank of England .
This in turn led to investor panic and a bank run in mid - September 2007 .
Calls by Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesman Vince Cable to nationalise the institution were initially ignored ; in February 2008 , however , the British government ( having failed to find a private sector buyer ) relented , and the bank was taken into public hands .
Northern Rock 's problems proved to be an early indication of the troubles that would soon befall other banks and financial institutions .
IndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower ’s income or assets , and to borrowers with poor credit histories .
Appraisals obtained by IndyMac on underlying collateral were often questionable as well .
IndyMac often made loans without verification of the borrower ’s income or assets , and to borrowers with poor credit histories .
As an Alt - A lender , IndyMac ’s business model was to offer loan products to fit the borrower ’s needs , using an extensive array of risky option - adjustable - rate - mortgages ( option ARMs ) , subprime loans , 80/20 loans , and other nontraditional products .
IndyMac resisted efforts to regulate its involvement in those loans or tighten their issuing criteria : see the comment by Ruthann Melbourne , Chief Risk Officer , to the regulating agencies .
On the other hand , half of the poorest families did not have wealth declines at all during the crisis .
The Federal Reserve surveyed 4,000 households between 2007 and 2009 , and found that the total wealth of 63 percent of all Americans declined in that period .
77 percent of the richest families had a decrease in total wealth , while only 50 percent of those on the bottom of the pyramid suffered a decrease .

On the same day , the Bank of England and the European Central Bank , respectively , reduced their interest rates from 4.5 % down to 3 % , and from 3.75 % down to 3.25 % .
The U.S. Federal Reserve and central banks around the world have taken steps to expand money supplies to avoid the risk of a deflationary spiral , in which lower wages and higher unemployment lead to a self - reinforcing decline in global consumption .
In addition , governments have enacted large fiscal stimulus packages , by borrowing and spending to offset the reduction in private sector demand caused by the crisis .
The U.S. Federal Reserve 's new and expanded liquidity facilities were intended to enable the central bank to fulfill its traditional lender - of - last - resort role during the crisis while mitigating stigma , broadening the set of institutions with access to liquidity , and increasing the flexibility with which institutions could tap such liquidity .

During the last quarter of 2008 , these central banks purchased US$ 2.5 trillion of government debt and troubled private assets from banks .
Following a model initiated by the United Kingdom bank rescue package , the governments of European nations and the USA guaranteed the debt issued by their banks and raised the capital of their national banking systems , ultimately purchasing $ 1.5 trillion newly issued preferred stock in their major banks .
In October 2010 , Nobel laureate Joseph Stiglitz explained how the U.S. Federal Reserve was implementing another monetary policy --OOV-- --OOV-- as a method to combat the liquidity trap .
However , banks instead were spending the money in more profitable areas by investing internationally in emerging markets .
United States President Barack Obama and key advisers introduced a series of regulatory proposals in June 2009 .
The proposals address consumer protection , executive pay , bank financial cushions or capital requirements , expanded regulation of the shadow banking system and derivatives , and enhanced authority for the Federal Reserve to safely wind - down systemically important institutions , among others .
In January 2010 , Obama proposed additional regulations limiting the ability of banks to engage in proprietary trading .
The proposals were dubbed " The Volcker Rule " , in recognition of Paul Volcker , who has publicly argued for the proposed changes .

The crisis played a significant role in the failure of key businesses , declines in consumer wealth estimated in trillions of U.S. dollars , and a downturn in economic activity leading to the --OOV-- global recession and contributing to the European sovereign - debt crisis .
The active phase of the crisis , which manifested as a liquidity crisis , can be dated from August 9 , 2007 , when BNP Paribas terminated withdrawals from three hedge funds citing " a complete evaporation of liquidity " .

The bursting of the U.S. ( United States ) housing bubble , which peaked in 2004 , caused the values of securities tied to U.S. real estate pricing to plummet , damaging financial institutions globally .
In the U.S. , Congress passed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 .
The financial crisis was triggered by a complex interplay of policies that encouraged home ownership , providing easier access to loans for subprime borrowers , overvaluation of bundled subprime mortgages based on the theory that housing prices would continue to escalate , questionable trading practices on behalf of both buyers and sellers , compensation structures that prioritize short - term deal flow over long - term value creation , and a lack of adequate capital holdings from banks and insurance companies to back the financial commitments they were making .

The U.S. Senate 's Levin – Coburn Report concluded that the crisis was the result of " high risk , complex financial products ; undisclosed conflicts of interest ; the failure of regulators , the credit rating agencies , and the market itself to rein in the excesses of Wall Street .
The 1999 repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act effectively removed the separation between investment banks and depository banks in the United States .
" The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that the financial crisis was avoidable and was caused by " widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision " , " dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions " , " a combination of excessive borrowing , risky investments , and lack of transparency " by financial institutions , ill preparation and inconsistent action by government that " added to the uncertainty and panic " , a " systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics " , " collapsing mortgage - lending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline " , deregulation of over - the - counter derivatives , especially credit default swaps , and " the failures of credit rating agencies " to correctly price risk .

As part of the housing and credit booms , the number of financial agreements called mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) and collateralized debt obligations ( CDO ) , which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices , greatly increased .
As part of the housing and credit booms , the number of financial agreements called mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) and collateralized debt obligations ( CDO ) , which derived their value from mortgage payments and housing prices , greatly increased .
As housing prices declined , major global financial institutions that had borrowed and invested heavily in subprime MBS reported significant losses .
Such financial innovation enabled institutions and investors around the world to invest in the U.S. housing market .

Total losses are estimated in the trillions of U.S. dollars globally .
Falling prices also resulted in homes worth less than the mortgage loan , providing a financial incentive to enter foreclosure .
The ongoing foreclosure epidemic that began in late 2006 in the U.S. continues to drain wealth from consumers and erodes the financial strength of banking institutions .
Defaults and losses on other loan types also increased significantly as the crisis expanded from the housing market to other parts of the economy .

While the housing and credit bubbles were building , a series of factors caused the financial system to both expand and become increasingly fragile , a process called financialization .
U.S. Government policy from the 1970s onward has emphasized deregulation to encourage business , which resulted in less oversight of activities and less disclosure of information about new activities undertaken by banks and other evolving financial institutions .

These institutions , as well as certain regulated banks , had also assumed significant debt burdens while providing the loans described above and did not have a financial cushion sufficient to absorb large loan defaults or MBS losses .
These losses impacted the ability of financial institutions to lend , slowing economic activity .
Concerns regarding the stability of key financial institutions drove central banks to provide funds to encourage lending and restore faith in the commercial paper markets , which are integral to funding business operations .
Governments also bailed out key financial institutions and implemented economic stimulus programs , assuming significant additional financial commitments .

The U.S. Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission reported its findings in January 2011 .
It concluded that " the crisis was avoidable and was caused by : widespread failures in financial regulation , including the Federal Reserve ’s failure to stem the tide of toxic mortgages ; dramatic breakdowns in corporate governance including too many financial firms acting recklessly and taking on too much risk ; an explosive mix of excessive borrowing and risk by households and Wall Street that put the financial system on a collision course with crisis ; key policy makers ill prepared for the crisis , lacking a full understanding of the financial system they oversaw ; and systemic breaches in accountability and ethics at all levels " .

During a period of tough competition between mortgage lenders for revenue and market share , and when the supply of creditworthy borrowers was limited , mortgage lenders relaxed underwriting standards and originated riskier mortgages to less creditworthy borrowers .
In the view of some analysts , the relatively conservative government - sponsored enterprises ( GSEs ) policed mortgage originators and maintained relatively high underwriting standards prior to 2003 .
The worst loans were originated in --OOV-- , the years of the most intense competition between securitizers and the lowest market share for the GSEs .

The majority report of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission , written by the six Democratic appointees , the minority report , written by 3 of the 4 Republican appointees , studies by Federal Reserve economists , and the work of several independent scholars generally contend that government affordable housing policy was not the primary cause of the financial crisis .
Paul Krugman has even claimed that the GSE never purchased subprime loans – a claim that is widely disputed .

Although they concede that governmental policies had some role in causing the crisis , they contend that GSE loans performed better than loans securitized by private investment banks , and performed better than some loans originated by institutions that held loans in their own portfolios .

They contend that there were two , connected causes to the crisis : the relaxation of underwriting standards in 1995 and the ultra - low interest rates initiated by the Federal Reserve after the terrorist attack on September 11 , 2001 .
Critics also point out that publicly announced CRA loan commitments were massive , totaling $ 4.5 trillion in the years between 1994 and 2007 .
They also argue that the Federal Reserve ’s classification of CRA loans as “ prime ” is based on the faulty and self - serving assumption that high - interest - rate loans ( 3 percentage points over average ) equal “ subprime ” loans .

His birthday ( 14 December 1895 ) was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great - grandfather , Prince Albert , the Prince Consort .
Consequently , he was baptised " Albert Frederick Arthur George " at St. Mary Magdalene 's Church near Sandringham three months --OOV-- ] As a great - grandson of Queen Victoria , he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth .
Within the family , he was known informally as " Bertie " .
Consequently , he was baptised " Albert Frederick Arthur George " at St. Mary Magdalene 's Church near Sandringham three months --OOV-- ] As a great - grandson of Queen Victoria , he was known formally as His Highness Prince Albert of York from birth .
Albert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship HMS Cumberland in the West Indies and on the east coast of Canada .
He was rated as a midshipman aboard HMS Collingwood on 15 September 1913 , and spent three months in the Mediterranean .
One year after his commission , he began service in the First World War .
His fellow officers gave him the nickname " Mr. Johnson " .
He did not see further combat , largely because of ill health caused by a duodenal ulcer , for which he had an operation in November 1917 .
In February 1918 , he was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the Royal Naval Air Service 's training establishment at Cranwell .
He was appointed Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys ' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918 , before reporting to the RAF 's Cadet School at St Leonards - on - Sea where he completed a fortnight 's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing .
Prince Albert qualified as an RAF pilot on 31 July 1919 and gained a promotion to squadron leader on the following day .
He accompanied the Belgian monarch King Albert on his triumphal reentry into Brussels on 22 November .
In October 1919 , Albert went up to Trinity College , Cambridge , where he studied history , economics and civics for a year .
Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the " Industrial Prince " .
His stammer , and his embarrassment over it , together with his tendency to shyness , caused him to appear much less impressive than his older brother , Edward .
However , he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis .
He developed an interest in working conditions , and was President of the Industrial Welfare Society .
An infatuation with the already - married Australian socialite Sheila , Lady Loughborough , came to an end in April 1920 when the King , with the promise of the dukedom of York , persuaded Albert to stop seeing her .
That year , he met for the first time since childhood Lady Elizabeth Bowes - Lyon , the youngest daughter of the Earl and Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne .
She rejected his proposal twice , in 1921 and 1922 , reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family .
In a time when royals were expected to marry fellow royals , it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife .
Because of his stammer , Albert dreaded public speaking .
After his closing speech at the British Empire Exhibition at Wembley on 31 October 1925 , one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners , he began to see Lionel Logue , an Australian - born speech therapist .
His journey by sea to Australia , New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica , where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man , which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races .
With his delivery improved , the Duke opened the new Parliament House in Canberra , Australia , during a tour of the empire in 1927 .
The Duke and Duchess of York had two children : Elizabeth ( called " Lilibet " by the family ) , and Margaret .

As Edward was unmarried and had no children , Albert was the heir presumptive to the throne .
Edward had been advised by British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex - husbands .
Edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans .
The day before the abdication , he went to London to see his mother , Queen Mary .
He wrote in his diary , " When I told her what had happened , I broke down and sobbed like a child .
On the day of the abdication , the Oireachtas , the parliament of the Irish Free State , removed all direct mention of the monarch from the Irish constitution .

Albert assumed the regnal name " George VI " to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy .
In settling the issue , George 's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title and style " His Royal Highness The Duke of Windsor " , but the Letters Patent creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles .
Three days after his accession , on his 41st birthday , he invested his wife , the new queen consort , with the Order of the Garter .
George VI was also forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of Balmoral Castle and Sandringham House , as these were private properties and did not pass to George VI automatically .
George VI 's coronation took place on 12 May 1937 , the date previously intended for Edward 's coronation .
In a break with tradition , Queen Mary attended the ceremony in a show of support for her son .
Two overseas tours were undertaken , to France and to North America , both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war .
There was no Durbar held in Delhi for George VI , as had occurred for his father , as the cost would have been a burden to the government of India .
The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain 's appeasement of Hitler .
However , when the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938 , they invited him to appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with them .
However , when the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the Munich Agreement in 1938 , they invited him to appear on the balcony of Buckingham Palace with them .
While broadly popular among the general public , Chamberlain 's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the House of Commons , which led historian John Grigg to describe the King 's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as " the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century " .
In May and June 1939 , the King and Queen toured Canada and the United States .
From Ottawa , the royal couple were accompanied throughout by Canadian Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King , to present themselves in North America as King and Queen of Canada .

On 19 May , George VI personally accepted and approved the Letter of Credence of the new U.S. Ambassador to Canada , Daniel Calhoun Roper ; gave Royal Assent to nine parliamentary bills ; and ratified two international treaties with the Great Seal of Canada .
Both Governor General of Canada Lord Tweedsmuir and Mackenzie King hoped that the King 's presence in Canada would demonstrate the principles of the Statute of Westminster 1931 , which gave full sovereignty to the British Dominions .
The trip was intended to soften the strong isolationist tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe .
The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor , Edward VIII , was dispelled .

In September 1939 , Britain and the self - governing Dominions , but not Ireland , declared war on Nazi Germany .
George VI and his wife resolved to stay in London , despite German bombing raids .
The first German raid on London , on 7 September 1940 , killed about one thousand civilians , mostly in the East End .
In August 1942 , the King 's brother , Prince George , Duke of Kent , was killed on active service .
In 1940 , Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister , though personally George would have preferred to appoint Lord Halifax .
In 1940 , Winston Churchill replaced Neville Chamberlain as Prime Minister , though personally George would have preferred to appoint Lord Halifax .
Every Tuesday for four and a half years from September 1940 , the two men met privately for lunch to discuss the war in secret and with frankness .
After the King 's initial dismay over Churchill 's appointment of Lord Beaverbrook to the Cabinet , he and Churchill developed " the closest personal relationship in modern British history between a monarch and a Prime Minister " .
The King visited military forces abroad in France in December 1939 , North Africa and Malta in June 1943 , Normandy in June 1944 , southern Italy in July 1944 , and the Low Countries in October 1944 .

The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states , known as the Commonwealth , gathered pace after the Second World War .
During the ministry of Clement Attlee , British India became the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan in 1947 .
Other countries left the Commonwealth , such as Burma in January 1948 , Palestine ( divided between Israel and the Arab states ) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949 .

The Prime Minister of the Union of South Africa , Jan Smuts , was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit .
George was appalled , however , when instructed by the South African government to shake hands only with whites , and referred to his South African bodyguards as " the Gestapo " .

The stress of the war had taken its toll on the King 's health , exacerbated by his heavy smoking and subsequent development of lung cancer among other ailments , including arteriosclerosis and thromboangiitis obliterans .
A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after the King suffered an arterial blockage in his right leg , which threatened the loss of the leg and was treated with a right lumbar sympathectomy in March 1949 .

His elder daughter Elizabeth , the heir presumptive , took on more royal duties as her father 's health deteriorated .
The delayed tour was re - organised , with Elizabeth and her husband , the Duke of Edinburgh , taking the place of the King and Queen .
His funeral took place at St. George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle , on the 15th .

He was interred initially in the Royal Vault until he was transferred to the King George VI Memorial Chapel inside St. George 's on 26 March 1969 .
He became king at a point when public faith in the monarchy was at a low ebb .
In the words of Labour Member of Parliament George Hardie , the abdication crisis of 1936 did " more for republicanism than fifty years of propaganda " .
George VI wrote to his brother Edward that in the aftermath of the abdication he had reluctantly assumed " a rocking throne " , and tried " to make it steady again " .

The goalkeepers are the only players allowed to touch the ball with their hands or arms while it is in play and only in their penalty area .
The history of football in England dates back to at least the eighth century AD .
Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA have recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe .
The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely varying forms of football played in the public schools of England .

The Cambridge Rules , first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848 , were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes , including association football .
The Cambridge Rules were written at Trinity College , Cambridge , at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton , Harrow , Rugby , Winchester and Shrewsbury schools .
In 1862 , John Charles Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules .
Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules , most notably the Sheffield Football Club , formed by former public school pupils in 1857 , which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867 .

The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper , but a number of specialised roles have evolved .
Broadly , these include three main categories : strikers , or forwards , whose main task is to score goals ; defenders , who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring ; and midfielders , who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team .
The layout of a team 's players is known as a formation .

Defining the team 's formation and tactics is usually the prerogative of the team 's manager .
These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of The Football Association ( The FA ) in 1863 , which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the Freemasons ' Tavern in Great Queen Street , London .

Other English rugby clubs followed this lead and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the Rugby Football Union .
The eleven remaining clubs , under the charge of Ebenezer Cobb Morley , went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game .
The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games .

England is also home to the world 's first football league , which was founded in Birmingham in 1888 by Aston Villa director William McGregor .
The original format contained 12 clubs from the Midlands and Northern England .
The first official international football match also took place in 1872 , between Scotland and England in Glasgow , again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock .
The laws of the game are determined by the International Football Association Board ( IFAB ) .
The Board was formed in 1886 after a meeting in Manchester of The Football Association , the Scottish Football Association , the Football Association of Wales , and the Irish Football Association .
FIFA , the international football body , was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association .
The board consists of four representatives from FIFA and one representative from each of the four British associations .

As the Laws were formulated in England , and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within IFAB , the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in imperial units .
The Laws now express dimensions with approximate metric equivalents ( followed by traditional units in brackets ) , though use of imperial units remains popular in English - speaking countries with a relatively recent history of metrication ( or only partial metrication ) , such as Britain .

In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock , some competitions may invoke replays .
A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time , which consists of two further 15-minute periods .
If the score is still tied after extra time , some competitions allow the use of penalty shootouts ( known officially in the Laws of the Game as " kicks from the penalty mark " ) to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament .
Goals scored during extra time periods count toward the final score of the game , but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament ( with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score ) .
These involved rules ending a game in extra time early , either when the first goal in extra time was scored ( golden goal ) , or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time ( silver goal ) .
The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was France 's victory over Paraguay in 1998 .
In the late 1990s and early 2000s , the IFAB experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout , which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match .
The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was France 's victory over Paraguay in 1998 .
Germany was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition , beating Czech Republic in the final of Euro 1996 .
The referee may punish a player 's or substitute 's misconduct by a caution ( yellow card ) or dismissal ( red card ) .
A second yellow card at the same game leads to a red card , and therefore to a dismissal .
A player given a yellow card is said to have been " booked " , the referee writing the player 's name in his official notebook .
Non - players such as managers and support staff can not be shown the yellow or red card , but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner .
The referee may punish a player 's or substitute 's misconduct by a caution ( yellow card ) or dismissal ( red card ) .
Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game .
Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on - field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh .
Along with the general administration of the sport , football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game , dealing with issues such as comments to the press , clubs ' financial management , doping , age fraud and match fixing .
There has been a football tournament at every Summer Olympic Games since 1900 , except at the 1932 games in Los Angeles .
A women 's tournament was added in 1996 ; in contrast to the men 's event , full international sides without age restrictions play the women 's Olympic tournament .
Originally , the event was for amateurs only ; however , since the 1984 Summer Olympics , professional players have been permitted , albeit with certain restrictions which prevent countries from fielding their strongest sides .
The Olympic men 's tournament is played at Under-23 level .

The governing bodies in each country operate league systems in a domestic season , normally comprising several divisions , in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results .
Most commonly , each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season , in a round - robin tournament .
The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division , and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division .

Mali is the eighth - largest country in Africa , with an area of just over 1,240,000 square kilometres ( 480,000 sq mi ) .
Its capital is Bamako .
Mali consists of eight regions and its borders on the north reach deep into the middle of the Sahara Desert , while the country 's southern part , where the majority of inhabitants live , features the Niger and Senegal rivers .
Some of Mali 's prominent natural resources include gold , being the third largest producer of gold in the African continent , and salt .
A majority of the population ( 55 % ) are non - denominational Muslims .
In the late 19th century , during the Scramble for Africa , France seized control of Mali , making it a part of French Sudan .
French Sudan ( then known as the Sudanese Republic ) joined with Senegal in 1959 , achieving independence in 1960 as the Mali Federation .
After a long period of one - party rule , a coup in 1991 led to the writing of a new constitution and the establishment of Mali as a democratic , multi - party state .
Present - day Mali was once part of three West African empires that controlled trans - Saharan trade : the Ghana Empire , the Mali Empire ( for which Mali is named ) , and the Songhai Empire .

The subsequent military - led regime , with Traoré as president , attempted to reform the economy .
His efforts were frustrated by political turmoil and a devastating drought between 1968 to 1974 , in which famine killed thousands of people .
The Traoré regime faced student unrest beginning in the late 1970s and three coup attempts .
Anti - government protests in 1991 led to a coup , a transitional government , and a new constitution .
Peaceful student protests in January 1991 were brutally suppressed , with mass arrests and torture of leaders and participants .
Opposition to the corrupt and dictatorial regime of General Moussa Traoré grew during the 1980s .
During this time strict programs , imposed to satisfy demands of the International Monetary Fund , brought increased hardship upon the country 's population , while elites close to the government supposedly lived in growing wealth .

Carved - top instruments are common in American folk music and bluegrass music .
Much of mandolin development revolved around the soundboard ( the top ) .
Pre - mandolin instruments were quiet instruments , strung with as many as six courses of gut strings , and were plucked with the fingers or with a quill .
However , modern instruments are louder — using four courses of metal strings , which exert more pressure than the gut strings .
The soundboard comes in many shapes — but generally round or teardrop - shaped , sometimes with scrolls or other projections .
A round or oval sound hole may be covered or bordered with decorative rosettes or purfling .
Beside the introduction of the lute to Spain ( Andalusia ) by the Moors , another important point of transfer of the lute from Arabian to European culture was Sicily , where it was brought either by Byzantine or later by Muslim musicians .

There is confusion currently as to the name of the eldest Vinaccia luthier who first ran the shop .
His name has been put forth as Gennaro Vinaccia ( active c. 1710 to c. 1788 ) and Nic .
An early extant example of a mandolin is one built by Antonio Vinaccia in 1759 , which resides at the University of Edinburgh .
Another is by Giuseppe Vinaccia , built in 1893 , is also at the University of Edinburgh .
It resides in the Conservatoire Royal de Musique in Brussels , Belgium .
The transition from the mandolino to the mandolin began around 1744 with the designing of the metal - string mandolin by the Vinaccia family , 3 brass strings and one of gut , using friction tuning pegs on a fingerboard that sat " flush " with the sound table .
The mandolin grew in popularity over the next 60 years , in the streets where it was used by young men courting and by street musicians , and in the concert hall .
After the Napoleonic Wars of 1815 , however , its popularity began to fall .
The 19th century produced some prominent players , including Bartolomeo --OOV-- of Venice and Pietro Vimercati .
The export market for mandolins from Italy dried up around 1815 , and when Carmine de Laurentiis wrote a mandolin method in 1874 , the Music World magazine wrote that the mandolin was " out of date .
Beginning with the Paris Exposition of 1878 , the instrument 's popularity rebounded .
The Exposition was one of many stops for a popular new performing group the Estudiantes Españoles ( Spanish Students ) .
The instrument 's popularity continued to increase during the 1890s and mandolin popularity was at its height in " early years of the 20th century . " Thousands were taking up the instrument as a pastime , and it became an instrument of society , taken up by young men and women .
They danced and played guitars , violins and the --OOV-- , which became confused with the mandolin .
Mandolin orchestras were formed worldwide , incorporating not only the mandolin family of instruments , but also guitars , double basses and zithers .
Even as the second wave of mandolin popularity declined in the early 20th century , new versions of the mandolin began to be used in new forms of music .
Thousands of people had learned to play the instrument .
Luthiers created the resonator mandolin , the flatback mandolin , the carved - top or arched - top mandolin , the mandolin - banjo and the electric mandolin .

Like any plucked instrument , mandolin notes decay to silence rather than sound out continuously as with a bowed note on a violin , and mandolin notes decay faster than larger stringed instruments like the guitar .
Like any plucked instrument , mandolin notes decay to silence rather than sound out continuously as with a bowed note on a violin , and mandolin notes decay faster than larger stringed instruments like the guitar .
This encourages the use of tremolo ( rapid picking of one or more pairs of strings ) to create sustained notes or chords .
The mandolin 's paired strings facilitate this technique : the plectrum ( pick ) strikes each of a pair of strings alternately , providing a more full and continuous sound than a single string would .

The Neapolitan style has an almond - shaped body resembling a bowl , constructed from curved strips of wood .
It usually has a bent sound table , canted in two planes with the design to take the tension of the 8 metal strings arranged in four courses .

A hardwood fingerboard sits on top of or is flush with the sound table .
European --OOV-- commonly use a 13-inch scale instead of the --OOV-- common on archtop Mandolins .
Another family of bowlback mandolins came from Milan and Lombardy .
These mandolins are closer to the mandolino or mandore than other modern mandolins .
They are shorter and wider than the standard Neapolitan mandolin , with a shallow back .
The instruments have 6 strings , 3 wire treble - strings and 3 gut or wire - wrapped - silk bass - strings .
A developer of the Milanese stye was Antonio --OOV-- ( Milan ) and his family who made them for 6 generations .
Samuel Adelstein described the Lombardi mandolin in 1893 as wider and shorter than the Neapolitan mandolin , with a shallower back and a shorter and wider neck , with six single strings to the regular mandolin 's set of 4 .

--OOV-- said in this book that the new wire strung mandolins were uncomfortable to play , when compared with the gut - string instruments .
Also , he felt they had a " less pleasing ... hard , zither - like tone " as compared to the gut string 's " softer , full - singing tone .
At the very end of the 19th century , a new style , with a carved top and back construction inspired by violin family instruments began to supplant the European - style bowl - back instruments in the United States .

At the very end of the 19th century , a new style , with a carved top and back construction inspired by violin family instruments began to supplant the European - style bowl - back instruments in the United States .
This new style is credited to mandolins designed and built by Orville Gibson , a Kalamazoo , Michigan luthier who founded the " Gibson Mandolin - Guitar Manufacturing Co. , Limited " in 1902 .
These styles generally have either two f - shaped soundholes like a violin ( F-5 and A-5 ) , or an oval sound hole ( F-4 and A-4 and lower models ) directly under the strings .

The F-5 's more complicated woodwork also translates into a more expensive instrument .
Numerous modern mandolin makers build instruments that largely replicate the Gibson F-5 Artist models built in the early 1920s under the supervision of Gibson acoustician Lloyd Loar .

Other makers from the Loar period and earlier include Lyon and Healy , Vega and Larson Brothers .
Some notable modern American carved mandolin manufacturers include , in addition to Kay , Gibson , Weber , Monteleone and Collings . Mandolins from other countries include The Loar ( China ) , Santa , Rosa ( China ) , Michael Kelly ( Korea ) , Eastman ( China ) , Kentucky ( China ) , Heiden ( Canada ) , Gilchrist ( Australia ) and Morgan Monroe ( China ) .
This is especially true of violin music , since the mandolin has the same tuning of the violin .
The instrument was primarily used in a classical tradition with Mandolin orchestras , so called --OOV-- or in Germany --OOV-- appearing in many cities .
Travelling mandolin virtuosi like Giuseppe Pettine , Raffaele Calace and Silvio Ranieri contributed to the mandolin becoming a " fad " instrument in the early 20th century .

On the island of Crete , along with the lyra and the --OOV-- ( lute ) , the mandolin is one of the main instruments used in Cretan Music .
It appeared on Crete around the time of the Venetian rule of the island . Different variants of the mandolin , such as the " --OOV-- , " were used to accompany the lyra , the violin , and the --OOV-- .
Different variants of the mandolin , such as the " --OOV-- , " were used to accompany the lyra , the violin , and the --OOV-- .
Stelios --OOV-- reported that the mandolin and the --OOV-- were used to accompany the lyra in the beginning of the 20th century in the city of Rethimno .
There are also reports that the mandolin was mostly a woman 's musical instrument .
Many adaptations of the instrument have been done to cater to the special needs of Indian Carnatic music .
In Indian classical music and Indian light music , the mandolin , which bears little resemblance to the European mandolin , is usually tuned E - B - E - B. As there is no concept of absolute pitch in Indian classical music , any convenient tuning maintaining these relative pitch intervals between the strings can be used .

Another prevalent tuning with these intervals is C - G - C - G , which corresponds to Sa - Pa - Sa - Pa in the Indian carnatic classical music style .
This type of mandolin is also used in Bhangra , dance music popular in Punjabi culture .
Though almost any variety of acoustic mandolin might be adequate for Irish traditional music , virtually all Irish players prefer flat - backed instruments with oval sound holes to the Italian - style bowl - back mandolins or the carved - top mandolins with f - holes favoured by bluegrass mandolinists .
The former are often too soft - toned to hold their own in a session ( as well as having a tendency to not stay in place on the player 's lap ) , whilst the latter tend to sound harsh and overbearing to the traditional ear .

The mandolin 's popularity in the United States was spurred by the success of a group of touring young European musicians known as the Estudiantina Figaro , or in the United States , simply the " Spanish Students .
" The group landed in the U.S. on January 2 , 1880 in New York City , and played in Boston and New York to wildly enthusiastic crowds .

Mandolin awareness in the United States blossomed in the 1880s , as the instrument became part of a fad that continued into the mid-1920s .
According to Clarence L. Partee , the first mandolin made in the United States was made in 1883 or 1884 by Joseph Bohmann , who was an established maker of violins in Chicago .

Samuel Siegel played mandolin in Vaudeville and became one of America 's preeminent mandolinists .
Another pioneering African American musician and director who made his start with a mandolin orchestra was composer James Reese Europe . W. Eugene Page toured the country with a group , and was well known for his mandolin and mandola performances .
The instrument was primarily used in an ensemble setting well into the 1930s , and although the fad died out at the beginning of the 1930s , the instruments that were developed for the orchestra found a new home in bluegrass .

The famous Lloyd Loar Master Model from Gibson ( 1923 ) was designed to boost the flagging interest in mandolin ensembles , with little success .
However , The " Loar " became the defining instrument of bluegrass music when Bill Monroe purchased F-5 S / N --OOV-- in a Florida barbershop in 1943 and popularized it as his main instrument .

By the 1930s , single mandolins were becoming more commonly used in southern string band music , most notably by brother duets such as the sedate Blue Sky Boys ( Bill Bolick and Earl Bolick ) and the more hard - driving Monroe Brothers ( Bill Monroe and Charlie Monroe ) .
However , the mandolin 's modern popularity in country music can be directly traced to one man : Bill Monroe , the father of bluegrass music .
After the Monroe Brothers broke up in 1939 , Bill Monroe formed his own group , after a brief time called the Blue Grass Boys , and completed the transition of mandolin styles from a " parlor " sound typical of brother duets to the modern " bluegrass " style .
Monroe 's style involved playing lead melodies in the style of a fiddler , and also a percussive chording sound referred to as " the chop " for the sound made by the quickly struck and muted strings .
He also perfected a sparse , percussive blues style , especially up the neck in keys that had not been used much in country music , notably B and E. He emphasized a powerful , syncopated right hand at the expense of left - hand virtuosity .
Monroe 's most influential follower of the second generation is Frank Wakefield and nowadays Mike Compton of the Nashville Bluegrass Band and David Long , who often tour as a duet .

Chris Thile of California is a well - known player , and has accomplished many feats of traditional bluegrass , classical , contemporary pop and rock ; the band Nickel Creek featured his playing in its blend of traditional and pop styles , and he now plays in his band Punch Brothers .
Some well - known players include Marty Stuart , Vince Gill , and Ricky Skaggs .
Howard Armstrong , who is famous for blues violin , got his start with his father 's mandolin and played in string bands similar to the other Tennessee string bands he came into contact with , with band makeup including " mandolins and fiddles and guitars and banjos .
Mandolin has also been used in blues music , most notably by Ry Cooder , who performed outstanding covers on his very first recordings , Yank Rachell , Johnny " Man " Young , Carl Martin , and Gerry Hundt .
And once in a while they would ease a little ukulele in there and a bass fiddle .
" Other blues players from the era 's string bands include Willie Black ( Whistler And His Jug Band ) , Dink Brister , Jim Hill , Charles Johnson , Coley Jones ( Dallas String Band ) , Bobby --OOV-- ( Need More Band ) , Alfred Martin , Charlie McCoy ( 1909 - 1950 ) , Al Miller , Matthew Prater , and Herb Quinn .
The mandolin has been used occasionally in rock music , first appearing in the psychedelic era of the late 1960s .
Levon Helm of The Band occasionally moved from his drum kit to play mandolin , most notably on Rag Mama Rag , Rockin ' Chair , and Evangeline .
1 hit Maggie May features a significant mandolin riff .
David Grisman played mandolin on two Grateful Dead songs on the American Beauty album , Friend of the Devil and Ripple , which became instant favorites among amateur pickers at jam sessions and campground gatherings .
Styx released the song Boat on the River in 1980 , which featured Tommy Shaw on vocals and mandolin .
Some rock musicians today use mandolins , often single - stringed electric models rather than double - stringed acoustic mandolins .
One example is Tim Brennan of the Irish - American punk rock band Dropkick Murphys .
The 1991 R.E.M. hit " Losing My Religion " was driven by a few simple mandolin licks played by guitarist Peter Buck , who also played the mandolin in nearly a dozen other songs .
" Armenian American rock group System of A Down makes extensive use of the mandolin on their 2005 double album Mezmerize / Hypnotize .
" " Show Me Heaven " by Maria McKee , the theme song to the film Days of Thunder , prominently features a mandolin .
As in Brazil , the mandolin has played an important role in the Music of Venezuela .
Also , in the west of the country the sound of the mandolin is intrinsically associated with the regional genres of the Venezuelan Andes : --OOV-- , --OOV-- , --OOV-- , and Waltzes .
Today , Venezuelan --OOV-- include an important group of virtuoso players and ensembles such as Alberto Valderrama , Jesus Rengel , Ricardo Sandoval , Saul Vera , and Cristobal Soto .
To fill this gap in the literature , mandolin orchestras have traditionally played many arrangements of music written for regular orchestras or other ensembles .
Traditional mandolin orchestras remain especially popular in Japan and Germany , but also exist throughout the United States , Europe and the rest of the world .
The structure of a contemporary traditional mandolin orchestra consists of : first and second mandolins , mandolas ( either octave mandolas , tuned an octave below the mandolin , or tenor mandolas , tuned like the viola ) , --OOV-- ( tuned like the cello ) , and bass instruments ( conventional string bass or , rarely , --OOV-- ) .
Smaller ensembles , such as quartets composed of two mandolins , mandola , and mandocello , may also be found .

The word " mammal " is modern , from the scientific name Mammalia coined by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 , derived from the Latin mamma ( " teat , pap " ) .
All female mammals nurse their young with milk , which is secreted from special glands , the mammary glands .
According to Mammal Species of the World , 5,416 species were known in 2006 .
These were grouped in 1,229 genera , 153 families and 29 orders .
Except for the five species of monotremes ( egg - laying mammals ) , all modern mammals give birth to live young .
The three largest orders in numbers , are first Rodentia : mice , rats , porcupines , beavers , capybaras , and other gnawing mammals ; then Chiroptera : bats ; and then --OOV-- : shrews , moles and --OOV-- .
The next three orders , depending on the biological classification scheme used , are the Primates including the humans ; the --OOV-- including the whales and the even - toed hoofed mammals ; and the Carnivora , that is , cats , dogs , weasels , bears , seals , and their relatives .

At the end of the Carboniferous period , this group diverged from the --OOV-- line that led to today 's reptiles and birds .
The modern mammalian orders arose in the Paleogene and Neogene periods of the Cenozoic era , after the extinction of the non - avian dinosaurs 66 million years ago .
The early synapsid mammalian ancestors were --OOV-- --OOV-- , a group that produced the non - mammalian Dimetrodon .
In an influential 1988 paper , Timothy Rowe defined Mammalia phylogenetically as the crown group mammals , the clade consisting of the most recent common ancestor of living monotremes ( echidnas and platypuses ) and therian mammals ( marsupials and placentals ) and all descendants of that ancestor .
Since this ancestor lived in the Jurassic period , Rowe 's definition excludes all animals from the earlier Triassic , despite the fact that Triassic fossils in the --OOV-- have been referred to the Mammalia since the mid-19th century .

--OOV-- is more closely related to monotremes than to therian mammals while --OOV-- and --OOV-- are more closely related to the therians ; as fossils of all three genera are dated about 167 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic , this is a reasonable estimate for the appearance of the crown group .

The earliest known synapsid satisfying Kemp 's definitions is --OOV-- , dated 225 Ma , so the appearance of mammals in this broader sense can be given this Late Triassic date .
George Gaylord Simpson 's " Principles of Classification and a Classification of Mammals " ( AMNH Bulletin v. 85 , 1945 ) was the original source for the taxonomy listed here .
Simpson laid out a systematics of mammal origins and relationships that was universally taught until the end of the 20th century .
Since Simpson 's classification , the paleontological record has been recalibrated , and the intervening years have seen much debate and progress concerning the theoretical underpinnings of systematization itself , partly through the new concept of cladistics .
In 1997 , the mammals were comprehensively revised by Malcolm C. McKenna and Susan K. Bell , which has resulted in the McKenna / Bell classification .
The authors worked together as paleontologists at the American Museum of Natural History , New York .
McKenna inherited the project from Simpson and , with Bell , constructed a completely updated hierarchical system , covering living and extinct taxa that reflects the historical genealogy of Mammalia .
Molecular studies based on DNA analysis have suggested new relationships among mammal families over the last few years .
Classification systems based on molecular studies reveal three major groups or lineages of placental --OOV-- Afrotheria , Xenarthra , and --OOV-- which diverged from early common ancestors in the Cretaceous .
--OOV-- in turn contains two major --OOV-- --OOV-- and --OOV-- .
The first amniotes apparently arose in the Late Carboniferous .
They descended from earlier --OOV-- amphibious tetrapods , which lived on land that was already inhabited by insects and other invertebrates as well as by ferns , mosses and other plants .
Within a few million years , two important amniote lineages became distinct : the synapsids , which would later include the common ancestor of the mammals ; and the --OOV-- , which would eventually come to include turtles , lizards , snakes , crocodilians , dinosaurs and birds .

synapsids have a single hole ( temporal fenestra ) low on each side of the skull .
therapsids descended from --OOV-- in the Middle Permian , about 265 million years ago , and became the dominant land vertebrates .
therapsids descended from --OOV-- in the Middle Permian , about 265 million years ago , and became the dominant land vertebrates .
The therapsid lineage leading to mammals went through a series of stages , beginning with animals that were very like their --OOV-- ancestors and ending with --OOV-- cynodonts , some of which could easily be mistaken for mammals .
The Permian – Triassic extinction event , which was a prolonged event due to the accumulation of several extinction pulses , ended the dominance of the carnivores among the therapsids .
In the early Triassic , all the medium to large land carnivore niches were taken over by archosaurs which , over an extended period of time ( 35 million years ) , came to include the --OOV-- , the pterosaurs , and the dinosaurs .

By the Jurassic , the dinosaurs had come to dominate the large terrestrial herbivore niches as well .
The oldest known fossil among the Eutheria ( " true beasts " ) is the small --OOV-- --OOV-- sinensis , or " Jurassic mother from China " , dated to 160 million years ago in the Late Jurassic .

A later eutherian , --OOV-- , dated to 125 million years ago in the Early Cretaceous , possessed some features in common with the marsupials but not with the placentals , evidence that these features were present in the last common ancestor of the two groups but were later lost in the placental lineage .

Recent molecular phylogenetic studies suggest that most placental orders diverged about 100 to 85 million years ago and that modern families appeared in the period from the late Eocene through the Miocene .

The earliest undisputed fossils of placentals come from the early Paleocene , after the extinction of the dinosaurs .
The earliest known ancestor of primates is --OOV-- achilles from around 55 million years ago .
This tiny primate weighed --OOV-- grams ( --OOV-- ounce ) and could fit within a human palm .
The earliest clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of --OOV-- , from 164 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic .
In the 1950s , it was suggested that the foramina ( passages ) in the maxillae and --OOV-- ( bones in the front of the upper jaw ) of cynodonts were channels which supplied blood vessels and nerves to vibrissae ( whiskers ) and so were evidence of hair or fur ; it was soon pointed out , however , that foramina do not necessarily show that an animal had vibrissae , as the modern lizard --OOV-- has foramina that are almost identical to those found in the nonmammalian --OOV-- --OOV-- .
The earliest clear evidence of hair or fur is in fossils of --OOV-- , from 164 million years ago in the Middle Jurassic .
Modern monotremes have lower body temperatures and more variable metabolic rates than marsupials and placentals , but there is evidence that some of their ancestors , perhaps including ancestors of the therians , may have had body temperatures like those of modern therians .
Some of the evidence found so far suggests that Triassic cynodonts had fairly high metabolic rates , but it is not conclusive .
For small animals , an insulative covering like fur is necessary for the maintenance of a high and stable body temperature .
Air enters through the oral and nasal cavities ; it flows through the larynx , trachea and bronchi and expands the alveoli .
During exercise , the abdominal wall contracts , increasing visceral pressure on the diaphragm , thus forcing the air out more quickly and forcefully .
This type of lung is known as a bellows lung as it resembles a blacksmith 's bellows .

The epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick ; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer .
The epidermis is typically 10 to 30 cells thick ; its main function is to provide a waterproof layer .
The middle layer , the dermis , is 15 to 40 times thicker than the epidermis .
The dermis is made up of many components , such as bony structures and blood vessels .
The hypodermis is made up of adipose tissue .
Mammalian hair , also known as pelage , can vary in color between populations , organisms within a population , and even on the individual organism .
Light - dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa .
Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals , although there is also evidence that sexual selection , communication , and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well .
Most mammals are viviparous , giving birth to live young .
However , the five species of monotreme , the platypuses and the echidnas , lay eggs .
However , the five species of monotreme , the platypuses and the echidnas , lay eggs .
In particular , the sex chromosomes of a platypus are more like those of a chicken than those of a therian mammal .
Viviparous mammals are in the subclass Theria ; those living today are in the marsupial and placental --OOV-- .
Viviparous mammals are in the subclass Theria ; those living today are in the marsupial and placental --OOV-- .
This is the --OOV-- condition among viviparous mammals ; the presence of --OOV-- bones in all non - placental mammals prevents the expansion of the torso needed for full pregnancy .
In intelligent mammals , such as primates , the cerebrum is larger relative to the rest of the brain .
Rats , for example , are considered to be highly intelligent , as they can learn and perform new tasks , an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat .
In some mammals , food gathering appears to be related to intelligence : a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat , which must think to outwit its prey .
To maintain a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet .
An omnivore eats both prey and plants .
Furthermore , mammals that weigh more than 18 oz ( 500 g ) usually can not collect enough insects during their waking hours to sustain themselves .
The size of an animal is also a factor in determining diet type .
This view is commonly contrasted with rationalism , which states that knowledge may be derived from reason independently of the senses .

For example , John Locke held that some knowledge ( e.g. knowledge of God 's existence ) could be arrived at through intuition and reasoning alone .

The main continental rationalists ( Descartes , Spinoza , and Leibniz ) were also advocates of the empirical " scientific method " .
Aristotle 's explanation of how this was possible was not strictly empiricist in a modern sense , but rather based on his theory of potentiality and actuality , and experience of sense perceptions still requires the help of the active nous .
These notions contrasted with Platonic notions of the human mind as an entity that pre - existed somewhere in the heavens , before being sent down to join a body on Earth ( see Plato 's Phaedo and Apology , as well as others ) .
Aristotle was considered to give a more important position to sense perception than Plato , and commentators in the Middle Ages summarized one of his positions as " nihil in intellectu nisi prius fuerit in sensu " ( Latin for " nothing in the intellect without first being in the senses " ) .

Stoic epistemology generally emphasized that the mind starts blank , but acquires knowledge as the outside world is impressed upon it .
The --OOV-- Aetius summarizes this view as " When a man is born , the Stoics say , he has the commanding part of his soul like a sheet of paper ready for writing upon .
" Later stoics , such as Sextus of Chaeronea , would continue this idea of empiricism in later Stoic writings as well .
As Sextus contends " For every thought comes from sense - perception or not without sense - perception and either from direct experience or not without direct experience " ( Against the Professors , 8.56 - 8 ) .

During the Middle Ages Aristotle 's theory of tabula rasa was developed by Islamic philosophers starting with Al Farabi , developing into an elaborate theory by Avicenna and demonstrated as a thought experiment by Ibn Tufail .

The intellect itself develops from a material intellect ( --OOV-- al - --OOV-- ) , which is a potentiality " that can acquire knowledge to the active intellect ( --OOV-- al - --OOV-- ) , the state of the human intellect in conjunction with the perfect source of knowledge " .

So the immaterial " active intellect " , separate from any individual person , is still essential for understanding to occur .
In the 12th century CE the Andalusian Muslim philosopher and novelist Abu Bakr Ibn Tufail ( known as " --OOV-- " or " Ebn --OOV-- " in the West ) included the theory of tabula rasa as a thought experiment in his Arabic philosophical novel , Hayy ibn --OOV-- in which he depicted the development of the mind of a feral child " from a tabula rasa to that of an adult , in complete isolation from society " on a desert island , through experience alone .

In the late renaissance various writers began to question the medieval and classical understanding of knowledge acquisition in a more fundamental way .
Machiavelli in particular was scornful of writers on politics who judged everything in comparison to mental ideals and demanded that people should study the " effectual truth " instead .

The decidedly anti - Aristotelian and anti - clerical music theorist Vincenzo Galilei ( ca . --OOV-- ) , father of Galileo and the inventor of monody , made use of the method in successfully solving musical problems , firstly , of tuning such as the relationship of pitch to string tension and mass in stringed instruments , and to volume of air in wind instruments ; and secondly to composition , by his various suggestions to composers in his Dialogo della musica antica e moderna ( Florence , 1581 ) .

British empiricism , though it was not a term used at the time , derives from the 17th century period of early modern philosophy and modern science .
The term became useful in order to describe differences perceived between two of its founders Francis Bacon , described as empiricist , and René Descartes , who is described as a rationalist .

In response to the early - to - mid-17th century " continental rationalism " John Locke ( --OOV-- ) proposed in An Essay Concerning Human Understanding ( 1689 ) a very influential view wherein the only knowledge humans can have is a posteriori , i.e. , based upon experience .

Locke is famously attributed with holding the proposition that the human mind is a tabula rasa , a " blank tablet " , in Locke 's words " white paper " , on which the experiences derived from sense impressions as a person 's life proceeds are written .

In response to Locke , he put forth in his Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge ( 1710 ) an important challenge to empiricism in which things only exist either as a result of their being perceived , or by virtue of the fact that they are an entity doing the perceiving .

All of people 's " ideas " , in turn , are derived from their " impressions " .
Rather , he maintained , our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits , developed in response to accumulated sense experiences .
Hume maintained that all knowledge , even the most basic beliefs about the natural world , can not be conclusively established by reason .
Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning , and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument .
Thus , as a simple instance posed by Hume , we can not know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East , but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past .

Most of Hume 's followers have disagreed with his conclusion that belief in an external world is rationally unjustifiable , contending that Hume 's own principles implicitly contained the rational justification for such a belief , that is , beyond being content to let the issue rest on human instinct , custom and habit .

As John Stuart Mill put it in the mid-19th century , matter is the " permanent possibility of sensation " .
Mill 's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience .
The problems other philosophers have had with Mill 's position center around the following issues : Firstly , Mill 's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations .
Berkeley put God in that gap ; the --OOV-- , including Mill , essentially left the question unanswered .
Secondly , Mill 's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the " gap - filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all " .
It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science , the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not , either today or at the time Mill wrote , fall under the agreed meaning of induction .
The --OOV-- phase of post - Humean empiricism ended by the 1940s , for by that time it had become obvious that statements about physical things could not be translated into statements about actual and possible sense data .
There is , however , no finite set of statements that are couched in purely sensory terms and can express the satisfaction of the condition of the presence of a normal observer .
If we are to specify this doctor 's normality in sensory terms , we must make reference to a second doctor who , when inspecting the sense organs of the first doctor , would himself have to have the sense data a normal observer has when inspecting the sense organs of a subject who is a normal observer .
Logical empiricism ( also logical positivism or --OOV-- ) was an early 20th - century attempt to synthesize the essential ideas of British empiricism ( e.g. a strong emphasis on sensory experience as the basis for knowledge ) with certain insights from mathematical logic that had been developed by Gottlob Frege and Ludwig Wittgenstein .

They saw in the logical symbolism elaborated by Frege ( --OOV-- ) and Bertrand Russell ( --OOV-- ) a powerful instrument that could rationally reconstruct all scientific discourse into an ideal , logically perfect , language that would be free of the ambiguities and deformations of natural language .

By combining Frege 's thesis that all mathematical truths are logical with the early Wittgenstein 's idea that all logical truths are mere linguistic tautologies , they arrived at a twofold classification of all propositions : the analytic ( a priori ) and the synthetic ( a posteriori ) .

As a result , most metaphysical , ethical , aesthetic and other traditional philosophical problems came to be considered --OOV-- .
In the extreme empiricism of the --OOV-- — at least before the 1930s — any genuinely synthetic assertion must be reducible to an ultimate assertion ( or set of ultimate assertions ) that expresses direct observations or perceptions .
) came under sharp attack after World War II by thinkers such as Nelson Goodman , W.V. Quine , Hilary Putnam , Karl Popper , and Richard Rorty .
By the late 1960s , it had become evident to most philosophers that the movement had pretty much run its course , though its influence is still significant among contemporary analytic philosophers such as Michael Dummett and other anti - realists .
In later years , Carnap and Neurath abandoned this sort of phenomenalism in favor of a rational reconstruction of knowledge into the language of an objective spatio - temporal physics .
In the late 19th and early 20th century several forms of pragmatic philosophy arose .
The ideas of pragmatism , in its various forms , developed mainly from discussions between Charles Sanders Peirce and William James when both men were at Harvard in the 1870s .

James popularized the term " pragmatism " , giving Peirce full credit for its patrimony , but Peirce later demurred from the tangents that the movement was taking , and redubbed what he regarded as the original idea with the name of " pragmaticism " .

In later years he even emphasized the concept - driven side of the then ongoing debate between strict empiricism and strict rationalism , in part to counterbalance the excesses to which some of his cohorts had taken pragmatism under the " data - driven " strict - empiricist view .

Among Peirce 's major contributions was to place inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning in a complementary rather than competitive mode , the latter of which had been the primary trend among the educated since David Hume wrote a century before .

According to Peirce 's doctrine of fallibilism , the conclusions of science are always tentative .
The rationality of the scientific method does not depend on the certainty of its conclusions , but on its self - corrective character : by continued application of the method science can detect and correct its own mistakes , and thus eventually lead to the discovery of truth " .
In his Harvard " Lectures on Pragmatism " ( 1903 ) , Peirce enumerated what he called the " three --OOV-- propositions of pragmatism " ( L : cos , --OOV-- whetstone ) , saying that they " put the edge on the maxim of pragmatism " .

This in no way conflicts with the fallibility and --OOV-- of scientific concepts , since it is only the immediate percept in its unique individuality or " thisness " – what the Scholastics called its haecceity – that stands beyond control and correction .
This notion of perception as abduction has received periodic revivals in artificial intelligence and cognitive science research , most recently for instance with the work of Irvin Rock on indirect perception .

Around the beginning of the 20th century , William James ( --OOV-- ) coined the term " radical empiricism " to describe an offshoot of his form of pragmatism , which he argued could be dealt with separately from his pragmatism – though in fact the two concepts are intertwined in James 's published lectures .
